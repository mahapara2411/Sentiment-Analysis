            " Loved our stay at this hotel. The room was large and it had a microwave and a refrigerator. The location was right near Little Italy so there were plenty of eating options. It was only a short walk to the harbour, shopping centre, Gaslamp Quarter and trolley stops. The pool was nice and seldom used by the guests. We found it refreshing after sightseeing, as the tempereature when we were there was very hot. The rates of the hotel were also reasonable.The bed in the room was the most comfortable that I had slept in during our travels on the west coast.

            " The hotel was clean, nicely situated to Times Square and within walking distance to the nearest subway station. The continental breakfast was good and the staff were pleasant. My only complaint would be the elevators. During peak times plan to wait 5 to 10 minutes before one of the two available elevators is ready. I would suggest requesting a lower floor as the stairwell between the lobby up the 5 floor was not bad. I have a feeling if you stay on the 36th floor you would not feel the same way.\n",

Nighttime came and we had no idea where to stay. Hospital staff said there was a Marriott directly across the street. We made an online reservation and showed up around midnight. The desk staff was terrific, the room was outstanding and they couldnt do enough for us to get settled in. Stayed for nearly a week. The concierge lounge is great. And The gentleman that staffs the lounge in the morning is one terrific guy. His name is Ray. Ray made each morning visit wonderful. He was so accommodating and helpful. This man should be recognized as employee of the Marriott Corporation!Every employee was just great. And the on-site restaurant staff wonderful as well. And every front desk shift true hospitality professionals. While we did have a AAA discount they applied the Rush Medical rate. It really helped us out. A great property. Nice big and clean rooms. If you need to be at any of the nearby hospitals this is the place!Thanks guys!!!! Thank you so much for such wonderful feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we have shared your feedback with the staff. We hope to accommodate you in the future\n",

            " Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better. I will be share you comments to our team so that we can try to make the correct adjustments. Please feel free to contact my Directly if there is anything that I can do in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manger\n",

            " My husband and I wanted to do a staycation in our new town and stumbled upon The Pearl through our searches. It was a great find indeed. The decor has a mod, retro, hip vibe... full of earthiness, fun, and intentionality. The staff was extremely open and friendly and quick to offer suggestions about what to see and do around town. The beer and cocktail list is great. I strongly suggest the Marie Antoinette... the hint of lavender in it made it feel fancy. They are definitely helping lead the mixology trend of infusing interesting things together for a delish beverage. The room was great. Had a great radio with their own playlist which helped us stay with the whole vibe. I still miss our little goldfish friend. The only mishap happened at Happy Hour when we weren't told that the beer we ordered wasn't included in the happy hour special... but even that was readily remedied by the owner of The Pearl. If you want a unique boutique hotel, I definitely recommend this place. It's also near to the Sunset Cliffs. We are planning to go catch one of their Wednesday night flicks soon. :)Thanks for the killer review. We appreciate it. Come stay with us again soon!!!!!!

            " This is a very delayed review as it was 6 months ago this week that we stayed at the Pearl Hotel. Ive never felt the urge to write a review of a hotel before, but I really wanted to for this hotel as I was so pleased we found this little gem wanted to share our experience with others thinking of staying here. 7 of us Brits (age ranges between 30 62) arrived at the Pearl late on a Sunday night in November 2010 after driving from Las Vegas. The service we received at check in was great, we were advised on where to park our car (if you park on the street round the corner, its free as opposed to paying for parking outside) were shown to our rooms. It was nearly midnight when we got our luggage out of the car into our room when we discovered a (very minor) issue with our room. We werent going to mention it to reception but thought we would bring it to their attention. Without going into lots of detail (as it would be boring!), we received the best service over our 4 day stay we have ever had on our many trips to the US from this hotel. The reception staff were fantastic in helping to resolve our problem they went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our stay at the Pearl. You can tell this isnt a chain restaurant is a family run hotel as the little touches made a big difference to our stay. For example, they leave a note after cleaning your room each day telling you what the next days weather will be the menu for that evenings dinner at the restaurant. We were very fortunate to be offered a free meal at the hotel, to be totally honest we were hesitant at eating in the restaurant as we like to explore the local area rather than eat at our hotel for dinner. We were very pleasantly pleased at how yummy the food was, both my husband I had the burger loved it they arent lying when they claim it to be the best burger in the area! We were only disappointed that we left it till our last night to eat there as we would have had more food there had we ate there earlier. We ate in the outside little garden terrace although it was a chilly November night, it has several garden heaters that made it a nice cosy area to eat drink in. Before we headed out for the evenings, we had a few drinks in the bar the beer drinkers in our party were impressed at the wide array of lagers ales on offer. I had a lavender cocktail that I remember being very tasty indeed. There is a good seating area around the pool / cinema screen to enjoy drinks from the bar.With regards to the room, each one has its own fish tank on the wall which is something Id never seen before in a hotel I loved this detail. Between us we had 4 rooms so I got to see all rooms all were of good standard.The location is pretty good, we drove to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo Old Town none of which took that long to get to. For the evenings that we went out into San Diego, the hotel rang up for a taxi it didnt take long to reach our destination. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly if you are thinking about booking this hotel I recommend that you do as you wont regret it. 6 months on, all 7 of us who went on the trip adored this hotel we still talk about our stay there it was a real highlight of our 2 week stay to Las Vegas, San Diego, Anaheim LA. If we ever go back to San Diego, I will make sure we stay at this hotel if anyone who works at the hotel is reading this thank you very much for the fabulous service!Thank you very much for the detailed review. Awesome!!!!! The entire staff at the Pearl was honored to have you as our guest. Your kind words are so appreciated. hope you will come stay with us again in the future.

Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away..\n",

The concierge was helpful in arranging scheduling the complementary town car service to the pier and area restaurants for us, as well as the dock for our cruise departure. They also picked us up when we returned.The hotel restaurant was good, though not exceptional. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and room service the other. Service was friendly.We were subject to a Sweet 16 party our 1st night in the hotel. We complained about the noise and when we returned for our 2nd night the next weekend, we were upgraded. We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not.The hotel is lovely. The staff exceptional. Street noise is not a problem. Parties on the 7th floor - big problem. Great location - close enough to everything without being too close.

            " Normally JW Marriott properties are very well-appointed, service is great, rooms are spacious and clean, and all the elements of the property are well-designed. However, I found this hotel to be very poorly run, poorly maintained, and awkwardly designed. My department held a weeklong meeting there in mid-January, 2013. The staff was absolutely top-notch in terms of friendliness and accommodation. Shortly after checking in, I used the lobby bathroom and it wasn't clean. At all. The room was nice, clean, and large. The bed was comfortable. Above the bed, though is a smoke alarm with a bright green LED. Bright and annoying. Multiple people taped things over the light from the second night on.On several of the days i finished with meetings around 430-500 pm only to find that housekeeping had not been to my room. One day, they didn't come at all. The restroom by the conference areas is just a mess. Fixtures pulling out of the wall, screws missing, stalls unclean.I will say that the food was good (though i never tried the actual restaurant) and they had a lot of healthy options. There are several shuttles that will drive you within a certain radius for free. Getting one is a little bit of a CF as there didn't appear to be much of a system.This isn't a bad hotel. It is, however, a terrible JW Marriott.\n",

That and the charge for internet access were the only negatives I experienced here, and I will admit that paying for internet access is a pet peeve of mine. The ambulances they have no control over. The hotel has a modern contemporary appearance. The lobby was bright and inviting with a sitting area offering complementary Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, with complementary coffee/tea, a refrigerator, and a great work area. I was not able to see any restaurants within walking distance so I opted for the hotel restaurant/bar. The food was excellent as was the service and all reasonably priced for Chicago. They do have a shuttle service available however, I did not use it and unable to comment.

            " Traveled to Atlanta for family reunion. I've stayed at a Renaissance before, but not in the Atlanta area. I'm a Marriott Rewards member, so I try to stay within the Marriott family. I found hotel on Expedia.com and the reviews were decent.When we arrived, it was around 9 pm. The concierge was not present outside, so we proceeded to checkin at the front desk. The front desk clerk was ok, but did not have the bubbly personality that I am familiar with during a late checkin. Each time I went to front desk for information, the same personality was observed on different clerks. We were placed in room 624. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very spacious. The hotel is VERY large and has a center indoor courtyard. There are about 3-4 elevators for entire hotel. They were not slow, but often crowded.We stayed 3 nights and each night the parking was very difficult. There was a beauty pageant taking place during the same weekend, so parking was horrible. We found a spot each night, but it often took 3 times going around the parking lot before we found one that was a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I felt safe each time walking from the parking lot to the hotel. The pool area was very crowded, even an hour before it closed. They have two pools, one indoor and one outdoor. The indoor pool is a salt water pool. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and hopefully not during a beauty pageant event.Thank you for the detailed feedback on your recent visit. You were here during a very busy convention and am sorry our space was so active. I hope we have the chance to have you back soon and enjoy our amenities in the future!\n",

My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round.

            " While the room itself was clean enough, with newly renovated bathrooms, it stank of Lysol, and since I would not advise leaving the windows open, given the homeless people and drug addicts who wander around the open halls here, the rooms can be quite stuffy. But the problem is less the room, but rather the kinds of people that management allow to stay in the rooms. We stayed next door to Room 29 which is blatantly a brothel with people coming and going all night, and I even got solicited one night for some fun by a prostitute in the parking lot. Random people knocking on our door at 5am, smashing bottles outside the door, people arguing and fighting in the middle of the night. Rows of homeless people sleeping around the sides of the building. While they do have a security guard who wanders around, he does not do very much. The area is not dangerous per se, as we would come back for nights out on the town late at night and no one bothers you walking the streets as long as you mind your business. I could go on, but do yourself a favor, and dig into you pocket, pay a few dollars more, and stay away from this place. That way, you can actually enjoy your stay in SF.\n",

The ceilings are crumbling and have cobwebs hanging from the edges. I tried to find a convenient outlet for my electronics, and instead found garbage behind the bed. There was a hole in the wall in the bathroom, and I was afraid the toilet was going to overflow when I flushed it. I can honestly say, this is probably the most disgusting hotel I've ever stayed at.\n",

            " We learned quickly that what we call Florence is Firenze in Italy! Thankfully we got off the right train. We booked the hotel because of the proximity of location to the train station. Upon arrival I turned on my map app, and it was more like a 15 minute walk, so we opted to get a cab with all of our luggage. The location was good, and had many shops and restaurants around. The hotel is an older property, and still maintained nicely. The hotel doesn't have a door person to open the door for you or greet you. Check in was fast, and we were upgraded to a suite, nice touch! We also really liked the electronic roll down blinds for blocking out sunlight. This was a fun feature! The breakfast room was amazing, and had very good food!\n",

            " My stay was better than expected. It was unusual that check-in is on the top floor, but it didnt bother me (although the wait for the elevator can be a bit slow). I agree with one reviewer who commented that the hotel was a little confused on their design. The top floor (as pictured on their website) has a very nice contemporary feel a really good first impression. However, when I arrived on the 14th floor where my room was located, it felt like Gumbys grandma was hired to design it. Whoever chose this designer must have owed someone a HUGE favor because I have never seen lime green in that quantity. I would not have mentioned the dcor if I was at some cheap hotel in Vegas but I think it was strangely (and noticeably) out of place here. Despite that, the room met expectation, given the location. For the most part, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. If you look a little closer, you can definitely spot some noticeable wear and tear, but nothing that really bothered me. There were some perks that made the stay more comfortable a loofah scrub for the shower, disposable slippers and complimentary bottled water just to name a few. Outside the room, all the staff I spoke with were all pleasant and helpful. I had dinner (once) and breakfast (twice) at the restaurant XIX and found the food excellent each time. I would definitely eat there again. The location of the hotel is excellent 5-10 minutes walking distance from the Walnut Street entrance: Rittenhouse Square to the left, the Historical District to the right, the Theater District just down Broad street and the Convention Center up the street. I encourage using a taxi instead of renting a car as it looked like parking is a premium (I think I saw a sign at a parking lot that said 3.25 for every 20 minutes). One important thing: If you are a light sleeper and not used to the city sounds I recommend bringing ear plugs. The three days I spent there I could barely sleep a wink because I was constantly woken up by the sounds of sirens below (theres a hospital nearby). On the second night, I was woken up by what I think was street cleaning around 4 or 5 in the morning. It sounded like an alarm clock beeping for what felt like half an hour.I wouldnt mind staying here again if I was on business (i.e. company pays). Its a little pricey for what you get.\n",

            " We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West.

            " If you cant feel safe in the hotel room then where can you feel safe when away We experienced gross negligence on the part of the staff here. We returned to our room at night, after being out all day, and found the door wasn't securely shut and gave way to a simple push. Panicked, we took inventory of our possessions and luckily discovered nothing missing. I hate to think of what may have happened if an intruder entered the room and my wife returned alone. After informing the front desk, I wrote an email to the gen mngr and got a reply from their op mngr the next day. She informed me that our room had been accessed by keycards that were issued at check-in. I informed her that there was no way that we could have accessed our room during the times she gave me. She couldnt offer an explanation of how or why our door lock showed access. While we were away I know that staff had entered to clean so its safe to assume that it was staff who left the door unlocked/open. Again, a simple push opened the door so a simple push by staff to check if the door was securely shut would have sufficed to ensure our safety. Since we were offered no real explanation of why our door wasnt securely shut that night, I do not recommend staying at this Marriott location if you value your safety and the safety of your belongings. If you do find yourself here, before using your keycard when returning each night, try giving the door a push and see if it opens up.\n",

Pros: Good look, great location, good restaurant in lobby, nice beds and sheets, wifi and the desk helpful and superfast (can't understand complaints in other comments.) The women there were friendly and found us alternatives when the two annex rooms we were first given BOTH smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms we moved into smelled better but it would have been nice if the doors to their terraces locked. I play poker and sometimes leave cash in the room--or I do when I can lock it in. Also, lights broken in one and smoke alarm beeping in another of the 4 rooms: not a big deal, easily fixed, but not a sign of close attention, either. Tower might well be a different story, but l I would say, for now: avoid the annex.\n",

They kindly allowed me to stash a piece of luggage there two weeks in advance of my stay and they had it waiting for me in my room upon my arrival. Check in took all of two minutes and the host was friendly and efficient. Both the wake up call and taxi I asked for were expedited without worry. The room was large enough, spotless and had a warm charm with a comfortable bed. The plumbing and shower pressure were excellent. I can't comment as to whether it was noisy since I was tired enough to have slept through anything. I got a bite to eat at the bar and the food was tasty and served up by a helpful and polite barman. If you stay at the Pearl you won't be disappointed but be aware that you'll be charged for the boxes of water you drink that are provided in your room.Thank you very, very much for your great review.

Bathroom had no lock on its ill fitting sliding door and shower was a bit puny compared to most American hotels. However the room was very acceptable. As a British tourist I would have loved a kettle in the room, but when in Rome etc.Service was generally excellent from the staff with one exception, which was that housekeeping twice let herself into the room during late afternoon (even though the room had long since been cleaned) then turned around with no explanation when she saw we were there. We used the do not disturb sign during the rest of the stay but what she was doing still remains a mystery.WiFi was excellent.We never did locate the stairs which was a shame given we had to use the lift to travel just one floor.Breakfast was good, but pricey for what it was.The hotel is very well situated, pretty much in the middle of the city.Richard, it's an honor to have been part of your American experience.

Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return.\n",

            " Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail. I told the hostess when I gave my keys about the problems, all she said was, I'm sorry.. Good: Location, proximity to US 60 and downtown Williamsburg\n",

            " This was my first stay at Homewood, as I usually stay at the Hilton garden inn next door, but I will be staying at Homewood from now on. The room was spacious and comfortable overlooking the beautiful pool. Breakfast and dinner / drink reception is great. The food was not gourmet but it was pretty tasty and filling after a long day at Disney and its included with your room rate! My only issue, and it is slight, is that the parking lot was quite full by evening and it was difficult to find a spot, but I guess that means its a popular place. There is also tons of dining and shopping options nearby. This hotel is back off any main roadsso the noise level is quite low. Everyone I came in contact with at this hotel was friendly and very helpful. That is so important and much appreciated.Hello Rick S!Wow!! This review is awesome! I'm so excited to welcome you to the Homewood Suites brand. It sounds like you're a frequent guest of our sister property, Hilton Garden Inn, so kudos to you for trying another branch of the Hilton family. I'm also honored that we were your first! What a privilege! You definitely picked the right location to try out. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us. I'm so glad that we left a good impression on you.

            " My wife and I stayed here a couple of days during the first week of March, 2016. Our first trip to San Diego and we loved The Pearl along with SD. I think I would characterize The Pearl as personal and intimate. Natalie took our reservation by phone the day before then remembered us personally with a little note in the room when we arrived. David checked us in on arrival and treated us like an innkeeper greeting special guests. We had several dealings with Angie and she seemed like we were family. As a small businessman all my life I have always tried to spend my money with other small business people. If we ever make our way back to SD we will certainly 'spend our money' with The Pearl since it's so nice to feel appreciated.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, THANK YOU for your great review. We truly appreciate it. Thrilled to hear our staff delivered an excellent guest experience. Hospitality is so important to us. Thanks again for your support. Visit us again soon. Tell a friend!\n",

It was very hectic and stressful trip for us, so appreciated very friendly and helpful staff. When we were checking in we couldnt get the CC thru, they let us stay with a promise we would take care of it next afternoon after we get off the hospital. We had a booking for 2 days, but we decided to go home after first night since we were alreaady done with our business in SF, they didnt even charge us cancelling fee.

            " When checking in we asked for a room on the top floor was told one was not available. The amount of noise from the rooms around us was incredible. The next morning we asked to move to a room where a guest had checked out-again we were told none were available. After returning to our room we received a call saying one was avail and we could move rooms immediately. Since this was first thing in the morning it tells me that this room was avail when we checked in. If you want a quiet hotel, DON'T stay here. When a door from a room closes or when someone walks heavy in the hall or in their room, the entire building shakes it can be heard loudly in the room next door below. There was a baseball team with kids that appeared to be 10 yrs old staying here and running wild. The noise and floor/building rattling from a baseball team running up and down the hallways was very disturbing. The parents not once told the kids to stop running. It was really sad the lack of respect being shown to other guests. We talked to the front desk and they told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids. Yes it is!! It is up to you to ensure the comfort of all your guests and if kids are being too loud and parents aren't around, you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet. The hotel was loud, beds pillows were uncomfortable, the breakfast was less than average. Will we stay at a Best Western Plus again, yes. Will we stay at this location,NEVER!\n",

The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena.

We arrived late and the front desk area was not marked either on the outside of the hotel or on the inside. Yes, they are under construction but even hand written paper signs on doors or down hallways can be made to help clear up the confusion! The door to the front desk is under the scaffolding on the corner. It is not the obvious entrance. Mid-way down the building there is a large entrance easily seen but there are no signs of any sort giving any directions. A large sign inside announces that in mid-2015 the construction will be complete. When that happens the hotel will certainly be a great place to stay.

Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!\n",

            " We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!\n",

            " Room was pretty standard for New York and the price was very good. Loved the free internet access and breakfast that was included. Bathroom was good sized and the shower was very comfortable in size. I found the bed to be very comfortable and I slept great. I am pretty low maintenance so I did not have much contact with the front desk except for chick-in and check-out. Both experiences were quick and easy.My room was low but on the inside so it was very quiet. I slept great every night I spent there.The only downside to my visit was that the fitness facility is in an adjacent property. The temps were frigid so I was not keen on going outside to access the fitness center. as a result, I skipped my workouts.Dear SBolin,Thank you for posting your review on tripadvisor. I was very pleased to hear your comments on how you enjoyed our hotel, staff and loved the complimentary breakfast. We look forward to welcoming you again to the Holiday Inn Express Time Square.Best Regards,Team Holiday Inn Express Time Square\n",

            " Stayed here because I attended a seminar at the Catamaran hotel, a 10-15 min walk on the boardwalk. Hotel is right on the beach walking distance to many restaurants. Hotel and room is your typical older hotel in a beach town. Nothing special, but you are paying for proximity to the beach. The boardwalk is safe even in the early morning. Highly recommend CBW restaurant which is a healthy fast food place for salads bowls and wraps. Within a block of the hotel. Note: parking is extra. They have their own underground parking. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. You may be happy to know this winter we are continuing our renovation efforts, which include but are not limited to: new window treatments, bedding, and furniture in all the rooms. Hopefully the updates will create a more positive impression if you decide to stay with us again. Thanks again!\n",

            " The overall experience of staying 2 nights at the hotel was pleasant. Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay, instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant, that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub, which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing, instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings, and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient, room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly. My apologies for the hot tub. Were looking into what might have been the problem!

They booked me reservations at different restaurants and they have a shuttle that will take you anywhere within two miles, and pick you up! They have a good fitness center, a nice lobby bar, and a caf in the lobby.

You mentioned you were here on business and it was perfect for your needs. We have some great weekend rates and packages and might find it a perfect hotel for that weekend getaway too.

            " This was our second stay here and I knew exactly where I wanted the location of the room to be, top floor overlooking city, I requested this with booking agent, not sure if this was passed on. The hotel changed the room to top floor but could not put us in a city view room, had one overlooking the road at the back which could be noisy at times. We were asked if we wanted to park on the road as they were full, so presume they were struggling with garage space. It was safe and saved 19 a day.The room itself was clean and large with two queen beds, table and two chairs, settee and table, fridge, safe, coffee maker, ironing facilities. The bathroom is looking old, the plug didn't stay in the bath, on the last day the sliding door was pushed back that far by the cleaning lady we couldn't get it out and the air con is very loud. Could also hearing the plumbing from adjoining rooms.The layout of the hotel is interesting as it is built on a hillside, not for people with walking difficulties. The grounds are beautiful. There is a pool with loungers, but for the size of the hotel is small.The location of Old Town is great, with plenty to see and restaurants and bars to walk to.All the staff we met were very niceJust a shame we didn't get our view as it has spoilt our previous memories.Thank you for your loyalty to Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town. While its nice to hear you enjoyed your stay for the most part, Im so sorry we werent able to assign you to the room you desired. As Im sure you already know, there are many factors that go into room assignment such a room style, length of stay and previous guest check-out time. I hope youll give us another opportunity the next time you visit San Diego! Feel free to give my office a call so we can make sure you have the room you want. Booking direct will also guarantee the best reservation conditions. Thank you again for reaching out and leaving helpful feedback. I look forward to hearing from you. Enjoy your summer travels!

They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.\n",

            " I recently stayed at the Francisco Bay Inn during a conference in San Francisco, and based upon my last minute booking, was left with few viable lodging choices at a reasonable rate. This hotel is unclean, my room, and the room of my traveling colleague, had a funky unpleasant odor that required the AC to (partially) clear out. The bathroom had cracked floor tiles, peeling wallpaper, stains on the walls, and the decor is overall is extremely outdated.The glass door of the office/reception area has been smashed, and the outlet in my bathroom burned out and destroyed my relatively new Braun electric razor. The manager let me know they tested the electrical outlets, and since voltage was apparently normal, they wouldn't do anything about my razor.The location is convenient, and the woman who checked us into our rooms was nice. Otherwise, an overpriced, terrible place to stay. The Buena Vista a block down the street is a better choice for the same general rate.\n",

The rooms were a moderate size. There is a bit of noise from the streets below however it is a city destination. What I wish we knew beforehand is that it is opposite a night shelter for the homeless therefore there were. Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either. The lighting in the rooms was dim - little impractical and the plug sockets a bit suspect. Dear SGee2013, We're sorry to hear you had this impression.

            " Stay Report - 5/6 - 5/7Location: The hotel is located on Cumberland Avenue right between I-75 and I-285. It's easy walking distance from the Cobb Energy Center and a mile away from the new Braves Ballpark (Suntrust Park). Nearby is the Cumberland Mall and Akers Mill Square Shopping Center which have a bunch of restaurants and shops. There is no public transit options available. Hotel: The hotel is an older property, a 14 story brick building with a central atrium. There are five elevators which can be a little slow when the hotel is at capacity. The lobby has a restaurant that serves breakfast as well as a separate restaurant and bar which is open until 12 and serves food until then. The second floor has a lot of meeting space which was full when I was there. Check In: The agent checking us in seemed tired and worn out and wasn't overly friendly. I don't blame her though, now that the Braves park is nearby this hotel gets very crowded. She did confirm what credit card we wanted to use as well as if we still wanted two King rooms and a Double room. She even tried to get us all on the same floor which was really nice. Room: My room was a double that was quite nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was of a nice size with a hot shower and Aveda toiletries. There was a small mini fridge and a coffee maker as well. My only complaint was the TV was older and couldn't handle digital channels. Restaurant/Lounge: We had drinks and dessert in the bar which was understaffed and crowded though the cocktails and desserts were quite good. The lounge was of a decent size and comfortable and had a pretty good breakfast spread. Hot oatmeal, grits, bacon, sausage and eggs as well as breads, really good pastries and fruit and cereal.Our rate was 160/night and for a Braves game this is a good hotel.Thank you for the extensive feedback! I am happy to tell you that we are getting new TV's in July / August! They will be 55 and contain all of the latest in entertainment options. Please come back and see us!\n",

            " We were really looking forward to staying here. Unfortunately it was surprisingly disappointing. The room itself was very large and picturesque so we cant complain about this but the noise from outside made sleeping impossible some nights. The windows are obviously not double glazed so the noise from sirens was incredibly loud as they went up the street right outside the window. Also no television in the room. I think thats a must now. We dont watch a lot but the option would have been great. Mostly though accommodation is about the people and we felt like intruders in someones house. No good mornings or how was your day when we came in. We realise it was not a hotel so dont expect that level of service but a hello would be nice. Such a shame its in a great location. Sally,I am sorry to hear that you felt unwelcome here at The College Club. We do try to greet guests daily and are always available in person, or by telephone after office hours, to hear and address concerns. We appreciate you bringing your concern to light here and will work to do better in the future. It is true that the noise from outside can, at times, be unsettling. It is an unfortunate fact of being situated on a major thoroughfare in a populated area. Some guests are accustomed to it, some are not. Had we known of your trouble sleeping we would certainly have moved you to a room on an upper floor or away from the street. There is a television in the breakfast room which guests are welcome to use at any time day or evening. We do hope that, overall, your trip to Boston was enjoyable and would welcome the opportunity to have you as guests should you return.\n",

            " My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good.

The windows were smeared and looked horrible. The fluorescent bulb above the vanity was missing and the desk lamp did not have a bulb. The front desk remedied some of it, but did not offer a discount or a free night's stay. Don't stay here unless it is your only choice!\n",

The staff was friendly, greeting me with a tour of the grounds, a description of the neighborhood, and escorting me to my room. The grounds and the room were lovely, exactly as advertised on the website. I stayed in the ocean view studio, which was beautiful, with a gorgeous view of the ocean. The room and the whole hotel is comfortable and relaxing and the perfect getaway.Greetings Sara T, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. On behalf of the the team, we are all so pleased that you had a perfect stay with us. We all strive to ensure that our guests have an enjoyable experience. I am so pleased that you enjoyed your accommodations and the comfort of the Inn. A lot of thought continues to go into what we can do to ensure that your first time with us is not your last.

            " We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response. Thank you again for your time and honest feedback. Have a great weekend!EJ Varela Hotel Manager\n",

            " Stayed at The Pearl for the weekend with my husband - our third time, and it just gets better! The Pearl is retro-modern hip, but without the attitude. Design is simple, comfortable, inventive, tasteful...and just cool. Arrived late Friday night to a busy bar- this place is happening, which we loved! We had a drink and then went to our room (23), a little worried if it would be loud, and were pleasantly surprised that it was not. Slept like a log in the amazingly comfortable bed.Had a wonderful dinner Saturday night - this place makes the best soups, the best burger and the best beignets ever! But what really sets this place apart is the service, from the front desk, to the bar, to the restaurant...they seem genuinely interested in making sure you have a great, fun stay.Will be back...Appreciate you detailed review!!!!!!!. Glad you had a great time. Will share your review with the entire Pearl staff. You are 100 correct, our staff truly values and cares about our guests. It's guests like you that makes the hospitality business so worthwhile. Thanks for your support and hope you will come stay a 4th time with us in the near future. Please tell a friend.\n",

Only downside was, although it was great to have a small coffee machine, it wasn't big enough nor did we have enough tea or coffee, or even cups for four people. I did ask on several occasions for more, but I did get fed up asking. This also went for the towels, having asked, again on several occasions, we only received three bath towels! We were there 7 days and I had paid for four adults so I am a bit of a loss why this kept happening. It was a bit irritating and slightly lacking on such a good hotel. I hope this will be rectified for future patrons.There is a small gym and a business centre with two computers and a printer, very handy for checking in to your airline and printing out boarding passes.The terrace garden is small but it was lovely to have a picnic alfresco in the city.I can't comment on the food here as we ate out all the time as there are loads of places to choose from locally. Walgreens Supermarket just up the street and left on Powell. Union Square just a little further down.In my book a clean hotel and location is key for me and the location of this hotel was spot on, easy access to all forms of transport, BART from the airport, trams, buses, muni metro and streetcar. Right next to the Chinatown Gate and easy access to all the tourist spots.We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in San Francisco in general, lots to see and do and the people are really friendly and welcoming where ever we went, and to cap it all off the Giants won the World Series and we were treated to a Homecoming Parade in their honour.....awesome.This hotel has good Eco friendly practices and will plant a tree for every review posted.Thank you for your great review, and as promised, we will definitely plant a tree for you for leaving a review on TripAdvisor! As you know we do this for all reviews, but are happier when it is done for a positive review. I'm so sorry to hear that your requests for tea, coffee and towels were never appropriately met.

I'm happy that you were able to take full advantage of the public transportation and enjoyed all the sights this beautiful city has to offer!

We heard from many other couples around the pool that had the same concerns and even the management staff when we commented on it said they knew it was an issue and were working on it. Three different managers said this. That said - Chris (the GM) addressed our concern and was fantastic. The front desk staff, housekeeping and bell staff were also very good. Their service at the Westin North property pool side is much higher at this time and I hope and expect that Nanea will get there soon. When you are on vacation you tend to spend a lot of time at the pool and thus was poor service there really stands out. Thanks Aloha Scott S,Mahalo for your review and your gift of feedback. Our General Manager, Chris Rabang, is always willing to go above and beyond to assure that each and every one of our guests is well taken care of. His leadership is a prevailing factor in our property's enormous success, despite only being open for 7 months.

We had a lovely view of the green while they had a view of the back of buildings. I'm sure each room has its pros and cons. The only shocker was that they didn't supply bar soap and shampoo. It didn't even occur to me that such a nice hotel would not supply basics like that. The four of us had to take time to find a CVS Pharmacy and stock up.The bed in our room was strange. I have never heard such a noisy bed when getting in and out of it. Creaking and moaning when I first sat down I thought I had a sleepless night ahead of me. However, once in bed, the mattress noises were minimal when moving around, it was just the getting in and out that was deafening.Other than that, I enjoyed my stay there and would consider them again the next time I'm in Boston.\n",

The bed was extra comfortable and lots of pillows. I traveled with two children their only complaint was the pull out couch was hard and lumpy.

            " Having stayed at the sister property the Coventry Motor Inn back in 2014 and enjoying it, we chose this place when looking for affordable accommodations (with parking) in a slightly different area. This time around, we were spending 2 nights in SF at the end of a 3 week roadtrip decided to do one hotel more budget (this one) and then the final night being a bit more of a splurge at another hotel on the Embarcadero.The hotel is easy to find, and we got lucky with a parking space right near to the lobby to check in. The chap was nice and we'd booked a room on the top floor to try and make the best of the limited views this location has - we were a little early but he called through there and then to the housekeeper who was working on our room, and she said it'd be about half an hour, so we had a wander and had a beer and a game of pool in the bar across the street, and were able to check in on returning.The rooms were very similar to the Coventry Inn, in that they are older style, but clean, spacious and comfortable. One added bonus with the Columbus Inn was the small balcony we had in our room - enough to step out on and watch the world go by and with surprising good views of Coit Tower and even a glimpse of the Golden Gate across the rooftops, so I was a happy bunny!We were getting to the end of our stamina on this 4000 odd mile trip, and so opted to order take out to be delivered to the hotel for dinner. It was easy, and after signing up to Grubhub online (with the WiFi being included in the room price) and selecting a place, we called down to let reception know we had a delivery coming and he said they would bring it right up to the room for us - something we're not used to in UK hotels, but very convenient for 2 weary travellers!We were able to eat properly too, as the room has a small dining table and chairs next to the window. Winner! The bathroom is only small, but has a separate vanity/sink area so it was still functional. We slept great in the large comfy bed, and grabbed a yummy breakfast next morning at a cafe in the next street in walking distance, so that was another plus. All in all, i'd recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again. Nice work Columbus!!! :-)\n",

            " I was so disappointed! It was my girl birthday, so I call them to make sure that I got a large bathtub and a king size bed. When I got to my room, I had the smallest tube in the world. Remind you that I'm 6'1' and a big dude. They also gave me a small double bed. My leg was hanging out the bed the whole night. To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room. I once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room that gave me everything I wanted in orlando, a king size bed and clean sheet. I wish I could get my money back. NOT HAPPY\n",

            " We stayed three nights at the Renaissance. When we arrived the bellman were great. They helped us get everything to the room and were very friendly. Everyone was nice and helpful. We had a problem with the remote and they sent someone up within 30mins to fix it. Hotel was very clean and quiet. They only person that didn't have a smile on her face was the lady who worked at the coffee/breakfast station by the entrance and she wasn't very friendly. We stayed in room 1234 and we had a great view of Sunburst Park. We opted for the package that included breakfast and the ballpark view. Breakfast was good, refrigerator in the room kept things cool and they had a microwave by the vending machines on the floor you could use. At night our room would go from cold to hot quickly. The air conditioner was running, it could've been us. Loved the extra room in this particular room. We had 2 queen beds, and plenty of extra room to move around in the room. NOW ONTO THE WALK TO THE STADIUM... So to get to the walkway over the interstate, you have to go to the back of the parking lot, up the side of the shopping center and then you are at the overpass. We were pushing two strollers and it wasn't very stroller friendly. When you get on the walkway, it is uphill most of the way and it ends in the red parking lot. The walk back is also terrible. We didn't ask the hotel if they provided transportation to the game because we have 2 strollers. If they do, I would suggest you take it or if they don't they need to provide transportation and make the passover easier to access. It's the first year and I know they will work out all of the kinks.Thank you for the helpful feedback, I appreciate it. There are a couple of different ways to get to the pedestrian bridge where you do not have to go uphill or use stairs. The next time we will direct you through the mall that is connected to us, it will take you directly to the bridge. I appreciate your business and hope to see you back!\n",

There was a little kitchenette for heating food at night. However the down sides were that the porch by the water was like a fire escape landing and people could go up and down the stairs. No privacy and can't keep door open at night to listen to the water. The room is pretty small for the price. The breakfast buffer wax excellent as wax the beautiful courtyard right near it.

The train station and trolley is right around the corner. They don't give very good written directions if you want them, they tell you where something is and you just hope you don't forget what they said. Overall, very happy with our stay.Dear Shoney75,Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am thrilled that you had an enjoyable stay with us. We are always excited and eager to make recommendations for guests when exploring the city, but I do apologize for the lack of written directions throughout your excursions. I have shared your experience with our staff and we will make sure to be as thorough as possible in the future.

            " We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away. The bed was clean,but the pillows really really flat,and I am not a pillow person.It was cold in the room so bring warm socks(this was in Aug), warm pajamas and a pillow.The washrooms were clean and the bathtub deep.The safe did not work and if the temp.outside was hot,we would be in trouble,because it the AC was missing knobs.The tv had 15 channels and HBO( a few great movies).The Wi-Fi worked and the morning coffee was good. The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own. SO the hotel it self is worth the savings,but the area I something to really really consider and I am a city girl.Stay in little Italy or near the Warf,these are the cleaner and safer areas.

Room was small and smelly, however the bathroom was really big and the shower had good water pressure. Traffic noise wasn't as bad as expected but if you are a light sleeper earplugs are recommended (and provided by the hotel). The room was clean but the fleece blanket on the bed was really dirty.

The front desk agents offered to hold our bags for us while we went and grabbed a bite to eat while our room was getting ready. When we arrived back, we checked in, which was super quick and fast! We were offered a free upgrade for a city view.....it was AMAZING! Before hopping onto the elevator, we grabbed a complimentary coffee and water from their 24 hour hydration station. When we arrived into our room, it was better than expected! Room is HUGE, especially for being in downtown Chicago. The kitchen is equipped with a stove, fridge, and breakfast bar area, living room has a desk, couch, tv, and large windows that open out that allow for awesome views! Bedroom is in a separate room....bed is SUPER comfortable which was great for us after a really late night out in the city!!! We did not take advantage of the complimentary hot breakfast, because we woke up later than we planned to and was rushing to catch our train. Next time we visit, we will hopefully take advantage of it!

If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.\n",

We appreciated her enthusiasm and kindness. The next day, we realized we need to extend another day and spoke with Nakayla Butler at the front desk. Wow, she worked some magic and got us in another night despite being full. This is why I have been staying exclusively at Marriott properties for over 40 years. This property even had a concierge, Jamie who seems to know every street and bargain to be found in Key West. You just cannot find a more consistently quality hotel chain than Marriott. Thanks to everyone at the Key West Marriott Fairfield Inn for a wonderful stay.Thank you for your comments regarding your wonderful stay with us. It great to hear the team members Rosemary, Nakayla and Jamie made the difference in your visit. I appreciate your comments and your loyalty to Marriott. Thank you for staying with us.\n",

The only issues we had were the noisy refrigerator and problems getting the key card to unlock the door the first time we accessed the room.

I spent many hours researching all hotels in San Francisco (many years have passed since I was last there) and came across CMI while researching. Let me say that this place was exceptional! Why Because it was 3 very short blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, one diagonal short block to the Powell/Mason cable line turnaround, super clean - no rips, stains, dirt, anywhere, large and to my utmost surprise, SUPER QUIET. No noise from other travelers (who gets lucky enough to not be able to hear other people staying in the building Very RARE). Outside was quiet at night (countless reviews complain of outside noise in other places). The staff (all of the ones we encountered - 3 or 4 male) bent over backwards to help make our trip a great one. Large bathroom, large room. This was one of the least expensive places for the area, value and room size, AND there is complimentary (FREE) parking (clean, well lit) and no resort fees!! Just those two alone can add up to 100 nightly to your room!! Wifi was also free and no issues using it at all (I read this is a huge issue at various other places). We will most definitely stay at this place again. Trips like this one are what memories of a lifetime are created from. Thank you for being a huge part of such a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything! Super happy customers!!! My friend is still talking about how perfect it all was.\n",

I found Ocean Park Inn from a San Diego travel website and could not have been happier with my find. I was nervous for what to expect, but was so thrilled when I arrived. Wonderful location with beautiful views!...perfect walking distance to stores, restaurants, and most importantly the beach! Also great location for driving to popular attractions. This hotel had an amazing beach front view. We first at the 1st floor ocean view room, did not like it due to it having a joined balcony with the other guests. Alexandra at the front desk did not hesitate and never asked questions about changing our room to the 2nd floor with the ocean view to have a private balcony. Both rooms were very clean as well as the whole hotel! All staff was very friendly and never hesitated to help in any way. Breakfast was very enjoyable with the area always kept clean. Pool and hot tub were great, especially with the palm tree and gorgeous sky view! Weekends around the hotel seem to attract a very large and lively college age group to the bars and surrounding area, however it all calms down the next day and week day nights. My husband and I felt very comfortable and safe there which was extremely important to us, that is why we recommend it to all the people we know and cannot wait to come back!!!...especially that the front desk staff was very accommodating when my husband surprised me by shipping our wedding cake topper to the hotel on dry ice to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful surprise and I thank them very much for allowing that which made our stay more memorable!\n",

            " stayed at the cute hotel in April 2015.It is easy access to stores ,and some restaurants .Close by is the local tram car on California street taking you to market street past china town. It has an old style elevator ,we took the stairs . There is free breakfast offered at the Italian restaurant connected to the hotel lobby and a snack consisting of wine and cheese in the lobby . Breakfast is very basic consisting of some fruits , pastries and very cheap bread .We would recommend eating out to a nice bakery on the same street called Flour and company and the coffee is of greater quality .The staff was friendly and helpful .The room itself had an odor of humidity but once inside could get used to. A small fridge and micro-wave oven was offered in the room .The room and hotel are very nicely decorated with an abundance of moldings ,carpets ,wall paper and is Air conditioned equipped .I would recommend it to the traveler on a budget .\n",

            " We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager\n",

We had Valet Parking on arrival and a welcome glass of wine in the library bar (and there was a complementary glass at 5pm each eve). Great place to hang out and swap stories.The location was great for all we wanted to do. Do get a comfortable pair of sketchers (there is a shop near by buy one get second half price) as you will be walking up and down hills a lot! The air conditioning in our room 709 was a bit noisy so I was glad we did not need it much. You get a faint hum of the San Francisco sound at night which I loved and was not disturbing . We didn't dine in at all so can't comment on the food . So many eateries in San Fran. to choose from and loris for breakfast just down the hill a few yards on the same side has great choice and sensible price. We spent three nights here over a week end with another couple in the next room and we were able to shut the outer door and kept our own door open on occasions so great if you are with family or with close friends!Would certainly recommend staying here.\n",

            " I called the hotel from the Atlanta airport where I was stranded. They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional, but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never, ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck, I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy, but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2, We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process, and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call.

Please email our General Manager, Terry Hitt, at tery.hittaloftatlantadtn.com, to further amend your situation.

            " Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.\n",

Take note, the safe functions completely differently than any others I've ever used. Our friends did the same thing in their room.

While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash.

Free Breakfast was a disappointing collection of frozen waffles, prepackaged muffins, bulk cereals, etc. No fruit, yogurts, or proteins. While rooms may be No Smoking sidewalks are fair game which defeats purpose of no smoking.\n",

            " Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel Convention CenterI had the occasion to attend the Revolution Chiropractic Convention in Atlanta. The convention was held at the Renaissance Waverly Hotel, this is a Marriott Property.The Hotel was up to the Marriott Standard, the young lady that checked me in, I think her name was Leah, she was delightful as well as very helpful. The room was spacious and clean, and the convention rate made it reasonable for a Marriott property. The bed in the room was amazing, it was like sleeping on a cloud, wow! So comfortable! For one who likes to sleep in a very cold room, I was a little disappointed that the lowest the thermostat would go was 65! I dont know if thats normal, in most hotels the first thing I do is to turn the air down to 62.I tried the breakfast buffet the first morning I was there, a little steep at about 22, can anyone eat 22 worth of food for breakfast It was awesome, they had EVERYTHING imaginable on the table. I ordered room service one evening, the burger was good, the service was fast and courteous. I was a little surprised, I ordered soup and was not given any crackers! I tried to call down, but they were so busy the phone was not answered.Overall a very good stay, I would certainly visit this place again.It is wonderful to hear about your fantastic stay with us and we appreciate the great comments. We hope that your travels bring you back to stay with us again. Thank you!\n",

Only negative was no outside drinks (1st time on Key West, is that normal), but there was an outdoor lanai just outside of our room for cocktail breaks.Free breakfast was good enough to keep us from spending money elsewhere. Used the gym twice- we may have been the only ones! Concierge was very friendly and knew everything about the island. Location is less than a half mile away from the nice bike/ hike trail that goes all the way up A1A.Dear Thaddeus 5,Thank you for sharing your experience, we are happy you enjoyed your stay with us. Our pool area is a wonderful area to relax in between all the fun activities in Key West.Just to answer your question about the outside drinks. We do not allow outside drinks because we do serve/sell alcohol at our Pool Bar, so it becomes a liability.But we are glad you enjoyed the outside patios!We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to Key West.\n",

            " We just came back from a 5 day stay at the Columbus Motor Inn in San Francisco. First of all, let me thank all of the Trip Advisor Members who stated this was a great place--we took your advise and went for it.the location is perfect, right on Columbus -- you can walk to all the major spots: North Beach, Coit Tower, Chinatown, Fishermans W., great restraunts....., cable cars, the Muni line is literally at the doorstep. Plus Safeway and Trader Joes if you need something.The front desk can answer any question.The hotel is being remodeled and so everything is new.And Free Parking!!!! a major Plus! Just park the car and experience SF on foot---you will not be disappointed.The only drawback is that we like to stay at places that have some breakfast snacks. the Columbus did not. But they have coffee makers to get you started( bring your own coffee though, theirs is weak) and their prices are lower then most other places in the area---so it was ok.\n",

            " Picked this Hotel, because it was within walking distance of a concert venue my mistake (I should have done more research). Sadly, the area is not the best (within one block east south there are considerable numbers of poor unfortunate people living on the sidewalk, in tents, in cardboard boxes and cars). Although, we did not have any trouble whatsoever we did witness open (injected) drug use on the street. Some may call it edgy or off the tourist track. Certainly not a place for families with young children to visit. During our visit we met a retired SF Social worker who told us Hyde St. (300s) is one of the dirtiest locations in the city and a good many of this former clients came from around that area.The hotel building (c.1904) was clean inside and the staff more than helpful. Out first room, on the fourth floor, although a double, was a disappointment very small and cramped, no draw space, tiny shower room, single glazing, overlooking the main street, very noisy (there is an Emergency Hospital directly opposite with vehicles coming in though-out the night).Our second room (floor two) was much larger, with ample cupboard/draw space and a bath and was situated at the rear of the building clean, but, again a little tired.There are a few places to eat nearby again, some care would be needed, not to go down the wrong street.The nearest public transport (Cable Car on the California line) is two blocks to the north and a 20minute ride will connect you with the downtown financial district.Pros: Price!Cons: Location.Visit Again: No, sadly, the adjacent area is too distressed.We were pleased to host you during your stay in San Francisco, and we hope that you enjoyed your trip to the city. It is also good to hear that the hotel itself was good, and we trust that you rested well. We know that the homelessness that is evident throughout the city can be very disconcerting for those who are not used to it, and we are sorry that you found aspects of this to be so off-putting. Please know that this is replicated throughout the city. Thankfully, our guests are never approached by people, and despite appearances, our area is very safe. Our building and some of our furniture are quite old, but we trust that you noticed the wonderful standard of cleanliness and upkeep that we maintain, and we hope that this did not detract from your stay too much. Overall, we are sorry that you did not enjoy your time here more. Best wishes, Hotel Management\n",

            " I checked into the JW Buckhead Thursday Jan 27 for 3 nights. I was in a regular room and ended up getting an upgrade to a suite for 20 more. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The suite was nice and spacious. The hotel overall was nice but could probably use a renovation sometime soon to keep up with all the other new hotels in the area. I went out to dinner and got back to my room at about 11pm. Shortly after I decided to take a shower then go to bed. Bad news! There was no hot water. I let the shower run for about 10 min, still no hot water. I called the front desk and they sent up an engineer. He confirms there is no hot water becuase the boiler was off He said he was going to fix the problem. So about 30 min later I get hot water. It is now after 12am and i really wanted to get some sleep as I had a meeting the next morning early. Before I showered I used the toilet and when I flushed it, the water almost came out of the bowl. It went back down and I flushed it again to see if it repeated. It did. So now I am calling the front desk again. They send up the engineer again who confirms the toilet is messed up and wouldn't be able to be fixed that night. I told him I had had enough of this and was tired of all the disasters happen in this room and expressed that I wanted to change rooms.They put me in another suite. I decide I'm going to shower and deal with management in the morning as it is now after 1 am. I am begining to wonder if I am staying at a JW Marriott or the Holiday Inn The front desk manager that I was dealing with that night made no offer of concessions for all the inconvenience I had endured. The next day I get back to hotel in the evening from my meeting and go to the front desk to speak to the manager about the horrible night I had. The front desk told me that the manager would call me in my room cause they were not available. About 30 min later, I get a knock on my door and it's the shift manager. He hears all that happened to me and I asked him how was Marriott going to make this right as I was about ready to check out and go stay else where.He stepped up and comped my room for the night before, also gave me reward points added to my Marriott Rewards card good for another night stay at a Marriott property. Then he also said to go ahead and order a meal before I check out and he would comp it. I was very satisfied with what he did for me and enjoyed the rest of my stay in my new suite. The managers name was Rick Gary and he saved Marriott from losing a customer. I was just expecting my room comped for the bad night and he went above and beyond to make things better. I will for sure stay at this property again my next time in Buckhead.\n",

Despite being a Non smoking hotel my room reeked of cigarette smoke. When I complained, the manager said there was nothing she could do. She didn't offer to move me - the hotel was not full. I think they just wanted all guests on the first floor so they could clean rooms while working the front desk. Several used fold-away beds were in the hallway for two days. All of the women who worked there brought their children to work with them. They seemed like nice kids, but this felt very unprofessional. All I want is a clean, quiet room.

            " Myself, husband, and two year old daughter booked 4 nights at the double tree. It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps.\n",

            " My boyfriend and I booked a last minute trip for the holiday weekend. First and foremost - the price was outstanding! We were quite pleased with it.The hotel was recently renovated and the rooms were very modern. The bed was heavenly and the room was comfortable overall. Also, the hotel is close to several local eateries, movie theater and the Silver Comet trail. There is a quiet restaurant, a cool bar, and a very convenient coffee bar in the hotel. The rooms were very large and easily accommodated all of our things (including 2 bikes). I also used the spa while there and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service. The spa was not very plush, but the staff was great and the service that I received was excellent.The only problems that we experienced were the kids that were running around the hotel all weekend (hence my title - great for families). The layout of the hotel seemed to make the parents comfortable with letting them roam (it is a very open hotel with visibility of the door to almost every room from any other room in the the hotel). The only other problem was that the room was not cleaned as thoroughly as it could have been. Although all of the room's accessories were new and modern (new lamps, bedding, towels, etc), the cleaning of the room was sub-par (like a 6 on a 1-10 scale). This was really our only ding on the hotel. Overall, great stay. And, if we ride the Silver Comet trail again, we'll probably stay at this same hotel.I appreciate your detailed feedback regarding your stay with us, it really does help us recognize areas we are doing well and those that need additional focus. I will share your comments with my Housekeeping Manager and ensure we follow through with additional training for that staff member. Please come back to see us soon!\n",

            " I am a huge Marriott fan. I always choose them when I can. This property sits right on the Stemmons freeway, which is quite noisy, all the time. I was able to get a room in the middle, so the noise was much less noise. The chair in my room (room 525) looked like a cat used it for a scratching post!! The room looks as if it had been updated recently. The bathrooms in this 2 room suite are quite small, and the exhaust fan in one sounds like a jet taxiing down the runway.They do provide free food in the evening, but it's gone by about 6:30, so don't be late! Breakfast is typical RI fare. I do wish Marriott would reevaluate the coffee choice for their properties. It's kind of bland in all locations that don't have a Starbucks.On a positive note, the staff was friendly, and the beds were very comfy!!

            " I'm a big fan of Best Western Hotels, because the majority of them accomodate my German Shepherd dog, this one is no exception except the other reason that I like Best Western is because the majority of them are designed well, and are well maintained, and offer rooms that feel fresh and clean, the Best Western Mission Bay seems to be the exception to the rule. The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room. We do have a large parking lot adjacent to the property were lots of our guest are allowed to park as well. We are always striving to improve, We would be more than happy to offer you a discounted rate in the future so we can have another opportunity to show you an excellent experience.

            " The good -- the hotel was nice, relatively new and had an indoor drop off lane, so getting in during inclement weather would be easy. The room was normal sized for this type of hotel, but typical HGI spartan, no in room safe, just basic furnishing. The ceilings were high, which gave the room a roomier feel for the size. The bad - we had a power outage for a few hours during the night, the whole neighborhood, not HGI's fault, but there are no emergency lights in the room, so if you didn't have phone or flashlight nearby, it was very dark (room darkening shades work well). The front door of the hotel is locked 24/7, making me wonder about the neighborhood. Our keys were either improperly programmed or were deprogrammed somehow and it took 2 trips to get them reprogrammed, the first one didn't work, and of course it happened when friends were waiting for us. The housekeeping staff tried to barge in our room at 8 a.m., check out was at noon and after getting up for an hour for the power outage, we were trying to sleep in. Then they went to the next room and banged the vacuum against the wall and adjoining room door waking us again. When I brought these issues with the desk on checkout, I was offered a bottle of water for my trouble, a less than satisfactory response. If the customer service was a bit better, it might have increased the rating.Hi Tom. Thank you very much for your feedback. While we're very glad to hear there were some aspects of your stay that went well, we deeply apologize for the other instances you mentioned. We're especially sorry to hear that you left with a less than satisfactory response from our front desk.

Exterior of hotel needs painting and maintenance. 4. Air conditioner in room is weak. 5. This is not a Marriott or Starwoods hotel. 6. Location to beach is very nice. 7. Parking in garage is very tight. I damaged my right side driver mirror trying to park our Yukon XL last night. The parking garage is setup for compact cars. Not everyone drives a compact car. 8. Hotel maintenance staff is very courteouse and responsive. It is my guess that hotel ownership is tight with capital dollars for improvements if they can fill the hotel without too much trouble at the rates they charge. 9. The empty building across from the hotel should be torn down. It detracts from the area. 10. The fire department is one (1) building over. This is good if you have a fire and from a security perspective but bad if they are out on calls and sound the sirens. 11. Only saw a few street people. The SD PD made two (2) arrests of street people when we were there. They were very proactive in this area. 12. The location of the SD Life Guard station is very positive. The beach are by the hotel is monitored heavily. The life guard staff on the beach were very proactive on currents in the ocean. 13. The beach needs to cleaned daily from the seaweed. 14.

            " I had high hopes for this hotel based on the price I was paying and the melia name plus the five star rating. I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything.

            " I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask. The hotel strikes me as a property that was redone (or built) in the 2000s. The linen and furnishing, wall coverings,... More\n",

            " Hotel is definitely outdated. Room was quite large, bed was comfortable, but furnishings, bathroom fixtures are old. Best thing about it was price which includes free parking and the location was great - close to Fisherman's Wharf, Starbucks and a Walgreens. It's a 10-15 minute walk to Washington Square area in North Beach with lots of great restaurants. I'd probably prefer a nicer and newer hotel but the free parking made the rate at least 50-60 less per night than other hotels in the area. If I travel without a car, I'd probably prefer a different hotel in the same general vicinity.\n",

            " When my husband and I needed to come to Dallas for surgery for a rare spinal condition, we decided to stay at a Residence Inn. My problem had begun right after we sold our home and we had been staying in a wonderful Residence Inn in Holtsville NY for over 3 months and loved it! They even helped arrange our stay here in Dallas. We have not been disappointed! The staff is helpful and friendly beyond words! The first room they gave us, as we had asked for a top floor in a quiet corner, had bar stool seating, which in my condition, was a problem. I thought I'd be eating on a computer desk for our month's stay! But as soon as my husband just mentioned it at the desk, we were allowed to see a handicap accessible room which turned out to be perfect. The room is clean and user friendly. It has a small kitchen with a microwave and 2 burners and supplies. There are lots of amenities. It is very comfortable. There are lovely complimentary breakfasts each morning with a wonderful variety as well as complimentary dinners 4 nights a week! The dining area is bright and cheerful. There is a lovely sitting area with a couch and armchairs and fireplace. The property is well kept with a beautiful pool area with a hot whirlpool and barbecue. The location is wonderful and once we learned the area, we found we are close to all sorts of stores and markets as well as Target, Walmart and Whole Foods. However you need a car to reach them. There is free Internet access and a downstairs computer if you do not have your own. There is also an exercise room that I regretfully can not take advantage of! However the most wonderful feature here is the staff...everyone of them! We will never be able to thank them enough for their kindness and helpfulness, whether it is with recommendations, directions or just being plain friendly. My husband and I have become big fans of Residence Inn! Both my children came to visit as well and loved it!Dear Guest,We are truly blessed to have you as part of our Residence Inn family. We are so pleased that your surgery went well and we hope you are continuing to improve every day!We hope to see you and your wonderful family in the future. Take care.\n",

            " I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather\n",

This hotel is as expensive and so much smaller than where we stayed in Paris in Trocadero a year ago. This room is so small. We have two double beds,each up against the wall. There is 2 feet at the foot of the bed to the table, closet and desk. The bathroom barely fits a sink, toilet and shower/bath. I have never been in such a small room at a Holiday Inn Express. I can not imagine trying to fit 4 people into this room.Dear Julie H,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us! We really appreciate you choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations during your stay and are disappointed in ourselves for allowing you to leave unsatisfied.

            " Overall a very nice experience at the Comfort Suites. Positives: The staff were ALL incredibly nice and helpful. Rooms were clean at check in. Washer and dryer in the room was a terrific perk, and came in handy with a week long stay. Nice breakfast - simple, but always had fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal and then the usual cooked items. Location could not be better, lots to see and do in the area, and lots of dining options.Not such positives:Daily housekeeping could do a better job - cleaning off kitchen counter, throwing away used coffee cups, etc. Rooms are a bit dated, and the sofa bed is in serious need of a new mattress (could feel every spring). Air conditioning was not great - especially in the hallway near our room. Only 2 elevators (tall, narrow hotel) so sometimes had to wait quite a while to get back to our room (or down to the lobby). we were on the 20th floor, so walking down stairs was not a great option.Dear TravlinGal1959,Thank you so much for your recent 4 star review. Thank you so much for your great positive comments on the team members, room being clean at check in and our amenities. Next month all of our sofa's will be replaced with memory foam mattresses and new sofa's. I do applogize for this experience but we are working on replacing them.

            " Nice old hotel in a busy location with lots of stuff to do in the area. Parking cost 15 a night which was ok and worth it. Small rooms. Hardly any guests in December when we were there. There is a no alcohol policy at the pool/hot tub which left us not using it. The 250 total cost per night seemed excessive but for the area is probably the norm. View of the ocean was great once you get over the homeless people openly using drugs on the boardwalk. All in all it was an ok place.Thank you for sharing your previous experience with us. We aimed to provide a 5 stars experience for all of our guests and we apologize for fallen short during stay. We appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention because we are always looking for ways to improve. In regards to the homeless situation...the boardwalk is city property, so there's a limit on what we can do. It frustrate us as much if not more than you because we know that can impact a negative experience for our guests. Rest assure that we are taking necessary measure to address this. Thank you for choosing Ocean Park Inn. We hope on the opportunity to provide you with a better experience the next time around.\n",

            " My stay was made spectacular due to the awesome customer service I received from one of the housekeeping staff: Teresa. This wonderful lady was truly the epitome of what customer service is all about. I was pleased with other staff members - front desk and shuttle van drivers - but Teresa is at the head of the class in this area. I was very impressed with the size of the eating area. I was very happy with the breakfast that was provided. My room was very comfortable, and contained a microwave and refrigerator. The shuttle van was definitely a bonus. Not only was there a shuttle van, but it operates 24 hours each day - at least that's what the shuttle driver told me. I've never known any hotel to have a shuttle that operates 24 hours each day, so this was very special. If you like to use public transportation as I do, you'll love the fact that the bus stops are right out front. The cost per night was very reasonable for what I received. The Wi-Fi was free, and there was never an issue. I do intend to stay at this property on my next trip to Chicago. Thanks Teresa for providing the quintessential customer service experience.\n",

From my initial phone call , a follow-up email and then one back from the hotel asking if we needed anything before arrival, it was the best dealings we have had with any hotel. They honored my request for extra towels and a high room away from elevators and ice machines. We overlooked Bush Street and heard very little noise and slept well on comfy beds. Hotel is well located, clean and does things right. Doormen, front desk staff and housekeeping were excellent. Our double superior room was bright, clean and larger than we expected. Do yourself a favor and consider the Orchard Garden in your travel plans to San Francisco. Don't know what previous reviews are complaining about concerning transportation from the airport. Our cab from SFO was 49.50 (before tip) and the hotel arranged a Lincoln town car for us back to the airport for 50 (before tip). Really can't beat that considering the cost of hotel parking in the city.Dear TwoRetiredOshawans,We are excited to read that you loved our hotel and found your accommodations pleasing for your stay.

            " Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.\n",

Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!\n",

            " The Breakfast staff were beyond wonderful. The Front Desk staff were always helpful and friendly. However, I did have an issue with closing charges that were applied to the card I used as a GTD only, resulting in a credit that seems to be taking forever. The hotel overall was always clean and well maintained. Elevators could have been built a little bigger!\n",

            " I do a good share of traveling and stayed here as a last minute situation. With the 405 night gouge, they really like taking advantage of weary travelers. The don't accept AAA or any other type of discount. The best part of the room was the view of the boardwalk, but everything else was very average or below average for hotel accommodations.Thank you for your feedback. Our prices are not meant to take advantage of weary travelers by any means. In fact, our rates are priced very strategically so we are neither the most expensive, nor the most affordable, property here in Pacific Beach. We set our rates so that we can confidently say that we offer the most value in town - no other property offers as many complimentary amenities and/or as affordable amenities as we do.That being said, room prices on the beach are generally higher than elsewhere because our location is simply unbeatable. Not only is our location unbeatable in San Diego, but there are very few properties situated like ours in all of Southern California.Lastly, prices during peak seasons, like spring break, will always be higher with the higher demand. We're disappointed you didn't find value in your stay with us, but you may find what you're looking for if you try again during the off-season when our rates go as low as 109!Thanks again.\n",

            " Our family stayed for 8 nights from May 21-29 at this beautiful property. We stayed in a 1room suite (2 queen beds). On the 5th floor with a pool view. Very spacious,comfortable and clean room. From time we arrived til we left we had the exceptional service. Especially the staff at breakfast and dinner. Your all the best and know what service really is. Always replenishing food with a smile. Never had any issues getting room service (extra towels etc..) Many thanks to Ebony for making our trip a memorable one. The kids loved the resort style pool and basketball. Both a hit with the kids. Visited the parks during days and enjoyed the lovely pool area in evenings. We enjoyed the dinner (M-Th) and order for the Hilton Garden once. Much preferred takeout from Chevy's MexIcan and Fruddruckers and enjoy a nice dinner in the pavillion lounge. The location is close to many restaurants (Chili's, Uno's, TGIF, Fruddrukers, Olive garden and lots more! There is a Walmart Supercenter about 5-10 minutes away if you drive along Turkey Lake road. Nice guest laundry available on 1st floor. Just minutes away are the Orlando Premium Outlets (Vineland Road) and Premium Oulets International is about 20 minutes away. Preferred international ones better. Best family resort in Orlando with everything you need and more. Disney is about 10 min away and everything else isn't too far either. Very nice lobby, pool area and overall imaculate property. The 2 hotels is joined by the carribean resort pool and awesome hot tub.We'll be back and if your a family looking for a great vacation don't hestitate to stay here!\n",

            " I was pleasantly pleased with our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. I booked at this Inn primarily due to its location. We were there for Pacific Beach's annual Holiday Parade (there were also Santa Run marathons) and we wanted a hotel that we could easily walk to and from the Parade Route that took place on Garnet Ave.The price seemed reasonable. I booked a King room with Partial View for 2 nights. The room choice was honored when I checked in, and readily available for me.I was greeted by a friendly staff at the front desk. The check in process was quick, but thorough... everything was explained to me: key card use, parking garage, breakfast hours, etc etc. The lobby had two very nice salt water fish aquariums that gave the atmosphere a cozy tropical beach feel even in December. The parking garage is underground, entrance is just to the right of the main lobby driveway. It's a tight entrance and exit, but the parking garage seems secured, and well-lit. The elevator back up to the lobby and room floors are right dead-center of the parking garage, so every spot is nice. But the way there is only one elevator on the property, but it never ever seemed too crowded or long of a wait any time we needed to use it. Getting off the elevator and then roaming the halls (3rd floor) that's when you realize how old the building is. You can tell that there are newer remodeling features such as the flooring and crown molding. There are plenty of windows all along the hallways, so it felt bright and fresh, unlike some hotels that have dark, no-window hallways. The curtains were simple and plain. We found our King room (313) to be very spacious. Dresser, desk, sofa, king bed. Patio had a table and 2 chairs to sit down and enjoy the view of the pool below and ocean straight ahead.The bathroom was fresh and remodeled (definitely new compared to the rest of the inn. It was also fairly roomy and had a big shower- and good for very tall people as I saw the shower head was very high. Plenty of bath towels in a basket, as well as 2 blue beach towels which remained unused during this December visit.The closet is almost hidden as the door for it is actually a nice full size mirror. Once you pull the mirror door open, you'll find two of the most luxurious, double-layer terry cloth bath robes hanging for you (These robes are so comfy that we bought some to take home!!! The staff was kind to bring brand new ones for me to purchase).The bed was fairly comfortable... Firm (which is best for your back), but not rock hard. The white sheets and duvet were clean, fresh, and cozy. I fell asleep very easily. It remained quiet through the night, so either we had very quiet neighbors or decent thickness walls. -- A/C unit worked well... too well. Brrrr. Cooled the room down quickly then kept off. I could imagine it would be wonderful for summer.Things to note:-- Overnight parking is 15/day (compared to the other public parking lots available in this beach community, this was a good deal) and is in a gated underground lot. -- The entire property has a No-smoking policy, even outside on the patios. So if you are a smoker... this could be a deal breaker.-- Beach is literally steps away. You are right there.-- Continental breakfast includes a fancy Waffle maker... actually very good results and yummy even if you don't know how to cook. Everything else is your typical continental breakfast: bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices. Breakfast ends at 10am.-- I was surprised to find that you could get room service at this little Inn! Room Service is provided by the neighboring restaurant Firehouse. We didn't get to partake, but the menu looked wonderful. Because it comes from an actual restaurant conveniently next door, the options were plentiful and prices reasonable compared to most big hotel in-house room service.-- You are walking distance from so many restaurants, bars, convenient stores, market, and even a CVS pharmacy. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Ocean Park Inn. Pacific Beach is a neat little beach community. We got to experience it when the city was hosting a Santa Run marathon and a parade, so the activity was pretty ramped up. But even so, if anyone wanted to have a nice trip to the beach where you can just enjoy yourself at anytime of the year, I would recommend this place for sure.Thank you for taking the time to write a review for Ocean Park Inn.We are so pleased to read that we were able to provide you with an incredible experience. We are very fortunate for our one of a kind location and amazing staff. Your detail review painted a wonderful picture of what travelers can expect from Ocean Park Inn. As I'm sure, many future travelers would find your review to be very helpful. I love that you enjoyed our comfortable bath robes and even purchase some to take home with you. Next time you are looking to make another trip down to San Diego, I am so pleased to hear that you will return to us and would recommend us. We are all looking forward to providing you with another memorable experience.\n",

            " This was our 2nd time staying at Ocean Park Inn. Again, we stayed in a 2nd floor ocean front room. Great location, right on Pacific Beach. Very comfortable, fabulous ocean and beach views, balcony with small table and chairs overlook the beach. Unlike last visit, this time the wireless internet was completely useless in our room. I mean like non-existent. I had to go to the lobby to use wifi. Pretty inconvenient. They likely need to install few more routers. This reminded me of the state of things 10 years ago,when you'd wander around a hotel with your laptop, trying to find where you could actually get a wifi signal.. Spacious bathroom was renovated since last visit: bathtub removed and replaced with very spacious shower stall. Lots of drawers, decent closet -easy to keep organized. Pool, hot tub and patio area were great: impeccably clean: Staff were often out there picking up towels and tidying up. We swam in the ocean everyday, used the pool and hot tub every day. Very friendly staff. Location is as good as it gets: right on the beach, and walking distance to dozens of restaurants, bike rentals, coffee shops, and beach-and-souvenir shops. A Ralph's supermarket is a 3 minute walk away -great for lunch fixings, fresh fruit or a quick dinner from the deli counter. Free breakfast on site was good:: kids like to make their own waffles, good selection of yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, toast, jams and cereals, coffee, juice, milk. Never used the air-conditioner: enjoyed sleeping with sliding doors open, fresh sea breeze and the soothing sound of ocean all night. Not a luxury hotel, but it has everything you need, except useful wifi, is very quite and clean, has friendly staff and location couldn't be better. Teenage kids would like to return a 3rd time, maybe next year.Thank you for all of your positive feedback, we are so glad that we had the opportunity to welcome you back!I have wonderful news, we are currently working on upgrading our Internet. On your next visit to the Ocean Park Inn it will be running much quicker so you will have more time to enjoy relaxing out on your ocean view patio!\n",

            " In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms\n",

            " I spent nine days here and must say the people are the most responsive hotel employees I have ever experienced. The Shuttle service was superb we had them take us to breakfast, lunch and dinner several times each. This resulted from the extremely high prices in the dinning facilities within the hotel. That would be the lone drawback to staying here. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. Again, the best thing about a stay here is the staff you interact with they are the best!I am glad you enjoyed to stay with us, we hope to see you back soon!\n",

            " Stayed early June for six nights and disappointed that pool was closed when I arrived and remained closed for the whole of my stay, as this was one of the reasons I choose this hotel, location being the other reason.I was then allocated a room on top floor and immediately noticed an irritating humming noise and I wondered if it might have been air con units on roof and rang down to reception. A maintenance guy came up and said that it was same on all floors - after putting up with this for two nights I checked out lower floors and found this was not the case!! I went to reception and they agreed to move me to a lower floor, which was much quieter.I have complained about these problems but response from hotel has been less than satisfactory!On the plus side the hotel is in an excellent location, five minutes walk from Amtrak station, five minutes walk from Little Italy, and less than 10 minutes walk from the Bay with all its attractions. Rooms are of a reasonable quality, with decent amenities, if a little tired. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not great but was satisfactory and plentiful and staff were pleasant.\n",

            " I have written almost 150 reviews on Trip Advisor almost all of which were rated Very Good or Excellent. I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience. Happy Holidays!\n",

            " Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle.

            " What started out as a special weekend away for my boyfriend's birthday turned into a disaster. My boyfriend is a law enforcement officer and he and I reside in Highlands County which was the 2nd worst damaged county in Florida from Hurricane Irma. Since he was working mandatory overtime and we were without power for many days, I thought I would use my Hilton Honors points to find a hotel for our getaway.. Which is where I found your Homewood Suites. Upon checking in on Friday 9/22/17 we were greeted by the front desk clerk.. She was EXTREMELY nice and continued to deliver top notch services for us. We went to our room and discovered that we were given the keys for a double queen room. The beds were NOT true queen size.. We went back to the front desk with out luggage and when I explained that I reserved a King suite, we were told that there were not any King suites available, as they overbooked. I travel A LOT for work and I was surprised about this, and I felt that maybe they should have offered us a room next door to the Hilton Garden. We were not. The clerk re-assigned us to a 1st floor 2 queen and she said the manager would be checking with Hilton Honors to see what happened. She assured us she would leave a message for us after she found out what was wrong. After dinner and errands, we came back and there was no message, so I called Hilton Honors and they 3 way called the hotel and they said that they would offer us a room at Hilton Garden.. Well it was late at night, everything was unpacked and I did not want to go next door. Then almost immediately we were told that a King Suite just happened to come available, so we relocated to the King suite. That was 3 rooms in one night! The King suite was certainly not a King bed.. more like a queen. We woke up in the morning and went to the lobby for the hot breakfast (which was another reason I selected your hotel). The breakfast was not very good, eggs tasted funny and the sausages were not cooked all the way, and my boyfriend got sick, and my stomach didn't feel great either. Once we felt better we went out to Disney and enjoyed the EPCOT festival. When we came back to the hotel..hot and tired, we went into the room at 3:30 ish and the room had NOT been cleaned. I called down to get more towels so we could shower, which the front desk clerk had brought to the room and was so wonderful and apologetic. Housekeeping showed up at 6:30 pm after we were settled for the night. After showering I made the bed and discovered that there was not a blanket on the bed..it was a mattress pad..which explained why I was cold the previous night. We did not go to breakfast in the am and checked out. The weekend manager never spoke to us, never apologized and sent the clerk to do everything..Again the clerk was wonderful. So what started out as a wonderful surprise get away for my boyfriend turned out to be disappointing. I have been a Hilton Honors member since 2010 and I travel for work at least a couple times a month. I have never been so disappointed in a Hilton property as I was at your hotel. To make matters worse I found that I was double charged on my credit card today.. I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to get it straightened out.\n",

            " We made a last minute reservation at the Homewood Suite LBV for one night prior to driving to Port Canaveral for a cruise. Upon check-in, I wasn't quite sure how the visit would turn out as there was a heated conversation going on between a disgruntled customer and the desk clerk. The family had made a reservation for a one-bedroom suite and were assigned a studio instead. I understood the family's frustration after a long day of travel and I was a little concerned that I would not get the type of room I had reserved. Thankfully, the room we were assigned was great. The one-bedroom suite was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. We had a great night's sleep, enjoyed the free breakfast (which was pretty standard), and headed off for Port Canaveral. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.\n",

            " I recently stayed here while vacationing with my significant and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We had a room with an excellent view overlooking the boardwalk and beach. It was great to sit out on the balcony and be able to enjoy the view and action down below. The hotel and room were clean and up-to-date. The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens. The location was decent, located along the boardwalk with a number of restaurants, shops, and other hotels. Once we were there, we didn't have to drive anywhere since there was enough to keep us entertained close by.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy at night. There were a few people from the nearby bars yelling on the sidewalk, but fortunately it was brief and not late enough to wake us up. Also, the waves were much louder than we'd expected while trying to sleep, but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. Might be something to keep in mind if you are looking for a beach-front hotel. However, overall it was a fabulous experience!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time in Pacific Beach and enjoyed your room.On your next visit, if you'd like to be placed in the more quiet area of the hotel, please include it in your notes sections when booking your stay, we apologize for the unwanted noise level.We hope to have you back soon!

This is in the center of Chinatown, which is a prime location of San Francisco. Its very easy to access to banks, restaurants, Walgreens. Furniture are not new, there is no flat screen TV. But we were outside most of the time so its ok. We can walk from here to Fisherman Wharf (around 30 mins). The bonus is, parking is free. So we saved for parking.\n",

            " This is by far the best hotel in the USA we ever stayed in. Who cares the view on some backyard from the window. Not one sound from the busy Bush Street can be heard. The rooms on front should be sound proof according the hotel staff. The breakfast is basic and rather expensive. Cold hard boiled eggs, bread, coffee or tea and juices from the bottle and of course some cereals. For additionals high priced extras can be ordered. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The dinner food is great, but the choice very limited, so we had to go to the French restaurant Restaurant de la Presse on the opposite of the entrance in Bush Street. One remark about the sound proof quality of our room. At one moment it looked like our neighbours were really inside our room. They had a normal conversation and we could understand every word of it!!! So we were just lucky with quiet neighbours who did not shout or laughed loud or put on the TV set maximum! You better go for a room without connecting doors.The hotel is extremely green and was awarded for this, too. Free WiFi, which works fast all the time.A special compliment to the porters, who proved to be very helpful with good tips.\n",

            " It's not the swankiest hotel in San Francisco but it's in a good location and reasonably priced in the area (compared to other 400+/night). It's right down the street from Chinatown gate so you can easily grab some dim sum for brunch, close to cable car line that takes you to Fisherman Wharf, and close to Union Square shopping. Service was great- I arrived much earlier than normal check-in 11am fortunately they had a room available to check in to which was much appreciated. Room was very clean and comfortable. We also received 10 free minibar which was a nice bonus. Overall a nice stay for our one night in San Francisco.\n",

            " I have seen this before in other hotel brands but shocked that the JW Marriott has resorted to HVAC manipulation to save a buck. You know where you turn the thermostat to 65 at night and the air blows at 70 (if you're lucky). Actually in our case it was turned down to 60 because we overrode the thermostat and called maintenance when this didn't work and the air still couldn't have been any cooler than 70. The thing about it is that the air was working because the room would cool off in the daytime. Apparently they're overriding the air temp from a master switch and putting a cap on how cool it will be at night. I'm sure this is to conserve electricity but why can't they do this in the daytime when people aren't in their rooms or trying to sleep instead of at night when people actually care about the temperature! Just be aware if you like your room temp below 70 you probably won't be happy here.Dear WullaB86,Thank you for choosing us for your visit. Our team strives to ensure an enriching experience for each guest, and we regret letting you down.

            " The location of Holiday Inn Express on 39th near 9th Ave served my wife and I very well. We're a mid-40's couple on our first visit to Manhattan and in a three-day period were able to enjoy a wide array of sites and activities with Holiday Inn Express as our hub. The hotel is quaint (teenie tiny) and the limited space made the atmosphere very family oriented...you got to know your floor mates and people at the daily breakfast.We didn't take advantage of a specific view, so our 7th floor room looked over new construction on (we believe) on 38th. Elevator service is slow in this location, and, as expected, wasn't convenient during high-traffic times, so we adjusted our schedule a little. The lower floor customers appeared to use the stairs with more frequency. Staff is average...they enjoyed one another's company, and we're business-like with patrons. We did not use Concierge assistance, but notice the desk was manned regularly.Greetings Wyantabouttown,Thank you for providing us with your feedback on TripAdvisor.

            " Not recommended. Pulled in here after a lovely drive up from LA. We were all in great spirits until we were checked in. Without going into too much detail the girl at reception was short, rude and unhelpful. After going into our smelly rooms I literally walked back out, cancelled our booking via a website booking dot com (burning 400 for that nights accommodation), loaded up the car and drove around at 6-7pm at night on a Friday - till I found another place for our 3 night visit, which was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. The other place was actually pretty average but got a great deal and recouped the 400 on room rates, way closer to the Wharf/Lombard/Girardelli's area. Hi Tim, We are very disappointed that we were unable to meet your expectations, and that you were not greeted in the manner in which we aim to greet all of our guests.

            " My main beef was ,.. The room was extremely small and was not the one I booked per the picture. I had to go in sideways into the bathroom and though things are small in general in Europe, the localization and the price I paid for this hotel room justifies a bigger bathroom door in the very least. Though the breakfast was varied and they do speak English, they could not make (regardless of language spoken), I am fluent in 2 and also speak some italian, they could not figure out how to make scrambled eggs!! Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly. Other than that, and the extreme price 350 per night, the hotel was exceptionally well located. Train station and Duomo and Piazzas are all like 3 minutes to 5 away in each direction. There are plenty restaurants and stores and attractions + tours to make your stay in Florence a memorable one.\n",

            " Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.\n",

She didnt, maid knocks on door the next morning saying Im scheduled to check out that morning. Dishwasher very loud. Run it when youre gone.This is a decent, but underperforming Hilton property in need of updating, but was a disappointing stay for a Hilton property. This is a VERY competitive market so it may be wise to look elsewhere, but if you end up here its manageable. Overall I would give this property an 82/100 and an 80/100 for value. I would likely look elsewhere next time Im in the area, but since Im a Hilton Diamond member, I would end up at a Hilton property somewhere. In all fairness, I did mention my concerns to the front desk staff and the General Manager called me to follow up and made an adjustment on my bill which goes a long way in my book or I would have rated this property lower.

            " In the past I have stayed in Hotel Circle which is difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the area and the freeways. That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either. A good compromise for the price.Good Afternoon,We would like to thank you for staying with us and posting a review for Tripadvisor.Thank you so much for your compliments to our property.

The Hyatt at the Belleview died the disappoint although some minor things were a little bothersome. Overall we received great service from the team, starting with the really efficient and friendly lady that checked us in, she was great. We were given a complimentary suite upgrade on the basis of my status which was great. The room was huge, nicely laid out with a big living room and separate bedroom. 2 things bothered me about this suite, 1) the room itself was very dark, facing the inner courtyard there was practicallly no natural light and not enough lighting and 2) the bathroom was really small.The hotel is part of a Grande olde dame of a building that has been restored nicely to its former grandeur, this is also evident in the wrought iron staircases, wonderful ceilings and art spread throughout the hotel. Breakfast at XIX was good but not great - standard selections on the buffet that could be expanded a little - this was free as part of the Globalist status but does come up short when compared to other Hyatt hotels, but decent in any case. The hotels location is great if she our ein town to explore the city and its sights and museums, pretty much everything is walking distance.All in all this was a good hotel, if we ever get back to Philly we'll be basing ourselves there again.Thank you for your loyalty, and for choosing Hyatt at The Bellevue during your recent visit to Philadelphia!

            " We stayed here because there was a group on and I am a Mariott Rewards Elite member, AND I have stayed at MANY residence inn's across the US.This was a great location, right off the expressway and MINUTES away from most things in Dallas. We arrived and there was a little confusion on our room, but it was fixed, we were put into a one bedroom suite as we had reserved that had a door (we brought kids with us) and that fixed the problem, the night staff was very accommodating to our request.Breakfast was good, had a nice selection (basic eggs, sausage, OJ, Milk, Cereal, Waffles etc) ONE tip I could give the hotel is GET ANOTHER WAFFLE MAKER! Everyone LOVED the texas shaped waffles but had to wait forever to make one since there was just one of them! They also serve a dinner type meal M-Tu-Wed, which while we didn't get to try is a nice perk for business travelers watching their expense accounts.I read some other reviews and can say that while this isn't a 2014 newly built property it really is in great shape, wear and tear here and there but nothing that was really out of the ordinary from other hotels, there were no stains on the floors, no holes in walls, doors worked great, the noise outside the halls and outside were nothing bad and no weird smells!The pool was a little highly chlorinated and I think someone might have just not known how much to really put in, but it was a heated pool and the hot tub wasn't working at the time, but keep in mind that it was 40 degrees the day before and just into the mid 60's so I am sure it was just opening season.Also one tip I would say is bring your own pillows if you can, I did read on another review where someone said the pillows were small, yes they are and hard! The beds were comfortable but I would recommend the hotel upgrade and replace all those little tiny rocks (pillows).I think the front desk pulls double duty for housekeeping as a few requests that we requested never happened like an extra blanket and a few towels brought to our room but I could tell the front desk staff was working their hardest so I let it slide and just dealt with it. Over all we had a very nice stay, and this is a property I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay, centrally located and with a nice friendly staff.Thank you so much for the kind and generous words. We appreciate your high praise for our staff and hotel. We are always looking for ways to improve our offerings. Currently we are finishing our exterior updates, including new gardens.

            " Unfortunately the place was pretty old, even though they had renovated it a few years ago. When we first got to our floor, we heard a mom who was pretty upset saying they were getting the out of there. Another guest returned to room 421 saying, Pack up, we're changing rooms! And yet another guest went to the front desk to say the floor was wet when they checked into room 103 or 105 they were moved to another room too. We had four people in our room but only two sets of towels and one set of toiletries. There wasn't a safe in the room, though that was not explained I had to call the front desk to inquire, as the information card had directions on how to use the in-room safe (there aren't safes in The Annex, but there is one for all to use at the front desk). The TV didn't work for awhile, so i also called the front desk for that, and Maintenance came up the outlet it was plugged into was busted, so they just plugged it into another one and then it worked. The pool was okay, though we came down for one final dip before checking out at 11:30, but it was being cleaned -- at 10 on a Friday morning! No warning or any indication that it was going to be cleaned then, and a few guests besides ourselves were also waiting. There was also no mention of the beach chairs, umbrellas and towels, which I knew we had from the LivingSocial deal that brought us there to begin with only after asking the Concierge and going to the beach at 5 p.m., did we realize the service was only available until 6 p.m. The bathroom was the part of the room that showed the most age, especially the tub and shower, which ran at very low pressure and the temperatures were incorrectly labeled hot was cold and cold was hot. Room temperature was consistently cold too I had it at 85 degrees and it was still freezing.Now for some positives: The hotel's diner-type restaurant, Teplitzsky's, was awesome. Melissa was our waitress both at dinner and breakfast the following morning, and she was attentive and efficient, as well as very personable and friendly (she was also the only waitress at dinner, and one of two at breakfast). When we asked for more shampoo and conditioner at the front desk, housekeeping ended up delivering three more sets of toiletries, which was a nice surprise, though they were haphazardly thrown onto the counter in our bathroom (the sink of which was peeling off). Any time I dealt with the Front Desk, they were courteous and helpful. I thought I had left a ring upstairs after checking out, and they reprogrammed my room key to allow me back in. The jacuzzi was AWESOME, I have to admit wish I had more time to enjoy it, but I was with an 8-year-old so we were mostly at the pool. The retro decor in the lobby and hallway between the lobby and pool/restaurant were nice, as well as the Sea Spa's, but otherwise The Annex was just old. Oh, and it was great to have free wifi.Overall, it was a decent stay, but I doubt I'll be back, except maybe to try another part of the hotel, just not The Annex again. Either way, I would definitely go back to Teplitzsky's it was delicious and a great value, and they let us sit for as long as we wanted, which was great.\n",

When my family and I took a shuttle back from Disney we were dropped off 4 minutes away in the middle of the road while it was pouring and when we asked the bus driver he told us to f**k off his bus. No apology or anything. I was told by staff that I would receive some type of compensation (points, etc) however at the end of my stay I was told I will be receiving nothing. I honestly just wanted at least an apology for what my family had to go through that day and if Hilton is nice enough something else. Worst Hilton experience which is sad because my family and I always stay at a Hilton associated property because of the due care they have. Very sad by this stay and even more upset they way I was lied to and the situation was handled.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service.

            " We chose this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel. However, we spent less than 100/night here and we were happy with our choice.\n",

Front desk is typically your go to person for everything you need but during my stay this is an exception. It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this. I ordered a pizza which has nothing to do with the hotel but after an hour and a half I call the pizza place and they say it was left at the front desk because the hotel couldn't reach me. I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good. Rooms are clean and overall I would be satisfied if it wasn't for this particular staff member.

Very friendly and helpful staff. We were able to buy to park hoppers at a discount. The room was clean and comfortable. Wifi worked well. The grab and go breakfast snacks were nothing special. The walk to the parks was doable. We cut through the cast member parking lot across the street to Disneyland Hotel and onward to Downtown Disney. Sometimes we used the Monorail. It cut out a lot of the walk. The only downside for me is no in room safe.

Second to that, barely, is the stunning view of the ocean and the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs, punctuated periodically by the compelling barks of sea lions resting along the beach.

The property is on the beach (once you cross the boardwalk), so the location can't be beat and we are glad we stayed on-site so to speak as parking was hard to come by.The staff is very friendly and the pool area was very nice. Our room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast could have been a little better. Not too many choices and one day, they ran out of milk and juice. The boardwalk has a selection of restaurants and shops. We ate at Waterbar and it was good. Sandbox Pizza is good too and they will deliver. The hotel is in the Pacific Beach area which can get a little rowdy at night. We had no problems of things being loud and people were very respectful. The actual beach itself can be an issue. Make sure to find a place that doesn't have a lot of kelp or seaweed. That was a problem and then flies joined in. Be selective on where you set up shop. The water was chilly at first, but beautiful, we enjoyed our time there! Walk a few blocks to the Baked Bear ice cream shop - they make custom ice cream sandwiches. You won't be disappointed!\n",

While traveling through Atlanta last night I made a point of spending the night here but I was very disappointed to find that on multiple occasions, the offerings were trimmed because of a group in the hotel. The bar was serving a limited off-menu food service and the breakfast buffet, even though the front desk said it was the full buffet was only a limited, cheaper option for the group. I was really looking forward to a waffle and omelet, which of course weren't on the buffet today.

            " My Wife and 2 daughters stayed for 5 nights in early April 2012 and had booked a Family room with 2 double beds. The room turned out to be much smaller than expected (after staying in many family rooms in UK) .The beds were 3/4 size at best and with one small wardrobe and 4 hangers (1 each) we decided to book another room. To be fair the staff (whilst they could do little about the extortionate rate we had to pay for the additional room) were very helpful and understanding and this continued during the stay. There are 6 rooms on each floor of the hotel and with 36 floors and just 2 lifts there can sometimes be a wait. Breakfast was included and was basic and the breakfast room a bit to small for the number of guests the food was always hot and fresh (Omelets , Sausage patties , bagels Etc) and the staff were helpful. Even though the address is Times square you are probably a good 10 - 15 minuet walk to the centre (Red Steps) which is not really an issue as you are located about the same walk from the Hells Kitchen area which is famed for it diverse restaurants. We took out the 3 day New York pass which we found to be good vale (approx 130 pp) and gets you into all the main attractions and also includes the Water Taxi and Manhattan Cruise (Well recommended). Whilst there we saw Sister Act after buying the tickets at the TKTS booth (located under the red steps in times square). The booth opens at 10am most days for matinee shows and 3pm for evening performances. Best advice is get there early as queues can be large but in fairness do move quickly one box office opens. We paid 66 each which was much cheaper than cost of pre booking in UK. All in all I can not say it was an unpleasant stay at the hotel as New York is more about the city than the room , however I would look for something else if you are after a larger family type room.Hi Andybev123! We really appreciate your detailed feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are glad to see you enjoyed your time here in NYC, but are disappointed that we failed to give you a Perfect stay.

When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.\n",

I feel that the bed is new and I saw too that they are delivering new bed mattress to the other rooms. The price I paid for the hotel is just enough for the expectations. Kinda just exact. I didn't have any negative vibes. The ladies staffs are great and helpful. I will come back on this hotel.\n",

            " I stayed here for a few days in a double bed room.Pros:- room clean- mattress and pillows very comfortable- free wi-fi - location very good: downtown, 3 minutes from the cable car terminus on Powell Street- staff friendly and professional.Cons:- given the location, it's a bit noisy at night. Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.\n",

When I made the reservation, it was not specified which section my room would be in. I guess I ended up booking a room in the Annex part, which was obviously falsely advertised. They must use the picture from their nicer rooms to advertise because this room was a piece of crap.

            " I come to San Diego several times a year. This time wanted to try 2 different hotels. Stayed June 21, 2016, Room 319. The check in and check out was a breeze. Everyone I came in contact was very professional and helpful. This stay was a partial ocean view, 2 QN room. I highly recommend if you could afford it, stay in a full ocean view. The partial ocean view means you will be assigned a room on either side of the hotel. From the patio you do get a slight view if you turn one of the chairs and put it right in the corner. If sitting on the other chair you will not be able to see the ocean. Again, did I say it is just a slight ocean view. Being on the side of the hotel it was harder to hear the ocean waves. I would bet that the full ocean view rooms you would definitely hear the waves as these rooms face the boardwalk and beyond that the beach. The patio has 2 chairs and a small end table. It is nice to be able to hang up wet clothes. You can leave your patio door open to feel the nice ocean breeze. I would highly recommend the higher floors so that you can leave your patio door open all night and be secure. As others have commented, this facility is no resort but it is not a motel either. It is perfect for a get away to the beach. The room is modern enough, the beds were comfortable, and a really nice big tiled bathroom. The vanity is inside the bathroom. The shower didn't have the best pressure but it was decent. The shower is big and enclosed in glass. The bathroom has huge thick beach towels to use. Yes the decor in the hallways and the carpet is very outdated but not old or shaggy. The carpet in the room was ok. There is a small fridge to put drinks in. All in all, the room is very comfortable. There is a continental breakfast. (Standard waffle making, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, danishes, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and drinks.) There is plenty of room to sit at a table. It was great for us, all the food constantly being restocked. The pool and hot tub were heated and great. Nice relaxing area with lots of pool chairs. What I liked as well is that you can go out the back of the hotel straight to the beach access. In fact, it's just across the boardwalk. There is a life guard station right there. After you day on the sand you can wash off at an outside shower at the hotel. This is so perfectly convenient to wash off the sand from your feet, clothes, and beach toys. Having a room/hotel so close is so convenient for potty breaks if you have kids. You don't have to walk a long distance to find a bathroom. It's just right up to your room. The underground parking was nice as this whole area is always crowded and parking hard to find. There is a price for the parking which all San Diego hotels seem to charge. It is underground and didn't have any problems finding space. You are close to the elevator and can lug all your suitcases easily. There is a Ralph's grocery store and lots of restaurants (fast food and fine dining) within walking distance. So everything is close by. You will need a car if going to Balboa Park, Old Town, etc. I love how practical this place was to bring kids and just had a good time. I will be coning again. Just wished it wasn't so expensive.We really appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this all of this feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the view and overall had a good time with your stay. Thank you for letting us know some areas of opportunity for us to work on, we are always striving to do better and we will take these suggestions very seriously. We hope to welcome you back again soon!\n",

The room had a musty smell, and the beds were the smallest I've ever had in a USA hotel...it was clean though, if old, and the bathroom was very big for the size of the room. However, I ended up paying over 200 a night, which even in San Francisco is a crazy amount for what is essentially just an old motel.On the plus side, the staff were friendly, and it's located in a nice, safe feeling area, just round the corner from a great shopping and eating street on Union St in Cow Hollow, which I'd highly recommend.It is what it is....if you can get a good rate then great, if not I'd shop around.\n",

            " This was our first stay at this resort. We stayed at Westin KOR last year and loved it, so decided to give it a try.We booked a 1 week stay through an owner on redweek. He was wonderful - very helpful in linking our 2 extra nights though the resort so we wouldnt have to move. He did tell me he had requested one of the bldg 8 high floor one bedrooms 1 year in advance, as these have the best view. When I checked in the front desk told me since I wasnt an owner and elite member I did not get preference and I was l placed in a 5th floor room in bldg 7 facing the courtyard and other rooms. They moved us mid stay to bldg 8, but through this I came to find out there are very few 1 bedrooms and they all have poor views or face the pool where loud noise can be heard until late evening. So, if you are looking to book a 1 bedroom beware. Youre better off at KOR where there are ocean front and ocean view 1 bedrooms. Many at Nanea face the parking structure. That being said the rooms are new and well appointed. The shower in the the 1 bedroom was not great... tub with curtain. At KOR they have the nice walk in rain shower, double sinks and a large tub.We did come here the week of Spring break, so expected it to be busy, but it was a bit on the insane side. The pool was packed everyday and seemed over crowded. They seemed under staffed as it was difficult to find a server on the pool deck and it was much faster to go to the bar and order. The other thing we noticed was the lack of cleanliness of the place. Trash everywhere, no one emptying the overflowing trash cans. The lounge chairs were pretty filthy, clearly not wiped down. The beach here is nice, but as others have noted, smaller and rockier than at KOR. We did enjoy snorkeling off the beach everyday with little kids. The waves are gentle and great for learning. We also had spectacular whale action everyday.End game, even though its older we preferred KOR and will book there in the future. Aloha baflier,E kala mai. We apologize for not meeting your expectations. On a personal note, we agree the loyal Elite 5 owner who hosted your stay is wonderful and it was a pleasure assisting him in linking your reservations and providing a room move option for you and your family during your stay. Kindly reach out to our Guest Services Managers should you need further assistance.\n",

Although at check in we were disappointed our booked room (a King Bed Suite) wasn't available, the substitute suite with 2 Queen beds was very acceptable. Rooms were very modern with a fully equipped kitchen and sofa bed in the sitting room and en suite off the bedroom. Maid service excellent and the room was spotless. In room safe very roomy and easy to operate. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning - fruit juice, cereal, toast, muffins, bagels, preserves, cream cheese, eggs, bacon or sausages, most days hash browns, fruit (apples, oranges bananas) and our favourite - waffles.

I'm a regular Marriott Rewards Elite member but usually stay at Courtyards. This just proves how one bad experience can influence decisions for many years. I was very, very pleasantly surprised when I walked thru the front door. Very attractive lobby, very friendly staff except for one bigger fellow at the front door who kept pushing for valet parking and unloading bags before we were even checked in. No tip for him, but everything was almost perfect from that point on. Very nice, attractive room, good a/c unit, quiet, and well designed. And very comfortable beds, good water pressure, and toiletries. With a walkway directly into Lenox and just across the street from Phipps the location is great. The drawbacks, 20 for self parking. You could probably avoid this by parking in a regular Lenox parking area but then again your car might not be there the next day. You do get in/out for no extra charge. The other negative is 12.95/day for inroom wifi but it does work. Supposedly it if free in public areas. The other drawback is food. The first night we were very tired and ordered room service. Expensive and bad. Too many good places nearby, so look elsewhere. Hope it comes up again. Definitely 4 star.\n",

Kim provided ample, courteous, attentive servers, and bartenders. We didnt wait for anything all night. I just cant say enough about the incredible service and food.

They also have an outside bar that our group enjoyed, stocked with all the liquors/wines anyone could want first class. The portions of food were plentiful, especially the desserts. The dining room was tastefully illuminated while the glasses, dishes and silverware sparkled. Everything is extra clean and inviting. Inside are several fire places to add a romantic ambiance. So if youre looking to celebrate an anniversary, or special occasion, choose this lovely Inn and you wont be disappointed. Entres range from 21 (chicken) to 31 (filet Mignon). A very quixotic atmosphere, I must say. Finally, be sure to do yourself a favor and pretend youre rich - eat here at very reasonable prices.view less\n",

            " Stayed at the JW to do my Christmas shopping. Location of this hotel is great as it is connected to the Lenox Mall. The MARTA station is also across the street which provides convinient transfers to downtown. At check in, I was told that they don't have a non-smoking king room available but could put me in a double room. I took that room without hesitation. The room was on the 21st floor, with a great view the skyline of downtown Atlanta. Tried to use the in-room internet but went off-line while I was using it. I call the front desk and later a person who is in charge with the in-room system called me and said I could use their internet facilities in the business center at no additional cost. Room service was not bad too pricy. Bathroom is spacious and marbled.\n",

            " I'll start with the good, very near Sea World and easy drive to Disney. Delicious breakfast, fun pool, and overall kind employees. But one major negative problem was cigarette smell. Our room was almost uninhabitable due to the smoke smell, it hit you in the hallway as you open the door! It was so strong everyone got a headache, so we avoided staying in the room as much as possible. Supposedly non-smoking hotel but this room didn't get the message. We told the staff and reminded them everyday (stayed three nights), and they never were able to move us to another room. And I left my number for the manager and attempted to meet with him multiple times, but he never called or was available. So they made absolutely zero amends for the situation, not even a real apology. Too bad, because this place should be a great stay, but they shouldn't claim to be smoke free and certainly could be more professional in at least calling me back when there is a problem. So I won't be staying there again and would not recommend it after my experience. Good Morning Sir,I would like to start of by apologizing sincerely about smoke smell you had to endure during the duration of your stay. Our goal is to always make sure our guest leave here satisfied, and unfortunately we failed at meeting that promise for you. We are non-smoking hotel for this very reason, I would like to talk to you more about your stay, please, if you could please give me a call here at the hotel 407-239-4540 EXT 134, I would love to talk to you about this. Once again we sincerely apologize and I look forward to hoping in redeeming myself and our brand with you Sir. Thank you Les Harris\n",

The rooms were fine and the beds very comfortable.They have a small indoor pool, which I enjoyed early in the morning when it was empty. Though I didn't use the rest of the spa, it seemed to be clean and well equipped.The only thing that really bothered me is how they nickle and dimed you. 14.95 for internet (which we were lucky to get free as part of the convention rate) and 5 for a bottle of water that is out on the table with an invitation to refresh yourself... That said, when I checked in, the front desk offered me a cold drink, which was a nice touch.I am glad you enjoyed your visit at the Waverly and appreciate the feedback.

We asked for a quiet room when we booked and so glad we did. It meant no view but we slept well. It is a bit dated and there was a very odd smell to the room. Only one lift in use throughout our stay. Overall it did the job with no frills. Next time I think I'll go for something newer or with character.

The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby.Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am).My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room.

Oh, the neighbouring property is called Bimbos which is what you might think, but even though our room overlooked it, there was no noise and nothing at street level that caused us concern.This place is a credit to the owners their staff.\n",

            " We stayed here for 4 nights 2 weeks ago while we took our two kids (3 years and 5 months old) to Disney. Our 3 yr old slept on the sofa bed in the separate living room which he thought was awesome because it was a hidden bed but I don't think it would have been very comfortable for an adult, fine for kids though. The kitchen was a nice size and fully stocked with dishes, fridge/freezer, cooktop, microwave and dishwasher. Our room overlooked the pool which looked nice we didn't get a chance to use it as we were too tired from Disney. The room size was nice for the 4 of us and had lots of room for the kids to play and a crib. We were very happy we decided to stay in a 1 bdrm suite instead of a standard room.The location was great it was about 5 minutes from Downtown Disney and was very easy to get to all the Disney parks. It would have been a good location for Universal Studios or Seaworld if we wanted to go there. It was very close to a bunch of restaurants that you pass on your way in and out of Disney.The breakfast was good, it wasn't amazing but was a good way to start the day and there was enough variety to keep all of us happy. The Mickey Mouse waffle was a big hit with our son.Thank you for staying with us at the Homewood Suites Lake Buena Vista.

            " My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids. LOL\n",

            " I traveled to Atlanta for a business conference and had the pleasure of staying at JW Marriott Buckhead for 149 night at the conference rate. The hotel was very clean and modern. The room was very big and the king bed I had was extremely comfortable. I had the best night sleep in a month. The staff were efficient and helpful. And the food provided for the conference was very good. The hotel is conveniently located just across the street from MARTA station so it was an easy 35 minute train ride from the airport, which could have not been easier. I paid 6 round-trip from airport. They have a very large pool, large hot tub and even a sauna. Very nice!I rated the hotel as 4 stars for two reasons: 1) Oddly, there wasn't a dresser in the room. Everything had to be hung up on the 8 hangers provided OR or stuffed in the very small nightstand drawer and 2) There is no wi-fi in the rooms. The rooms are supposed to have broadband, but I can't verify this. Others at the conference stated that their laptops couldn't connect using the internet cable in their rooms either.Wi-fi is available in the lobby. I just didn't want to sit in the lobby for any length of time.\n",

            " The hotel complex is spread out onto several different buildings and levels, including the parking garages, pool level, plazas and walkways joined by many stairways and elevators. You will need your property map and directions from the front desk, but for me it is worth discovering the beautiful plantings, fountains, plazas and vistas on the different levels.If climbing stairs is an issue make sure your nearest elevator is working and you don't have a room in the one building without elevator access.The breakfast buffet is generous, but for me the best part of the Tequila Factory restaurant is the several open or glass enclosed terrace dining areas which have wonderful views of San Diego harbor and Point Loma in the distance, both in the morning evening.When I visited in October there was an hourly shuttle to the airport and some local landmarks as well as on request pickup from the airport.We're honored to receive your review!

I booked at this hotel in February earlier this year. 3 days before I was to leave for the convention, the hotel emailed me stating they could not honor my reservations, but had moved me to another of their chain hotels some miles away. This was unacceptable due to the convention being in this hotel. I called and talked to management and was told that YES, we did purposely overbook the hotel, and that YES this is Marriott company policy. I was also told I would receive a call from the hotel manager the next day. This did not happen, nor would the initial front end manager answer her phone or return any voice mails. BEWARE, a confirmation number with Marriott means nothing. I am appreciative of the early warning however, as I was able to completely cancel the trip and cut at least some of my expense losses.\n",

For 56/night (taxes incl), close to everything, and away from the seedier parts of downtown, it's a pretty good deal.They don't change the sheets every day, but do you change your bed sheets every day at home I believe they change every 3 or 4 days, but you have to ask them.I didn't see any bed bugs. But I took precautions, just in case. I kept things off the floor, and I put a big clear plastic garbage bag around my suitcase. And I brought double-sided tape to use as bug trap if I needed it (which I didn't).The breakfast, if you chose to buy the breakfast tickets for 4, consisted of toast, bagels, milk, juice, boiled eggs, and a chocolate snack (all bought from Costco).There is WiFi, but you have to go into this big room on the second floor to get it - no big deal.If you need some deals or ideas of what to do, in the lobby, you will see a rack full of brochures. Some of those brochures have coupons in it for restaurants or ideas on what to do in SF.Yes, you don't get the quality of service in a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for.

I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that \"SHE TOLD ME\" the check out time. I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day.\n",

            " I stayed here recently for a business trip. The pros: location, food, nice rooms and amenities (comfortable bed, hot water, quality soap, shampoo and body wash, in room coffee). Most of the staff is great. I had a bit of a scratchy voice when I misplaced my room key and the front desk guy handed me a bottle of water and told me it sounded like I needed it which was so thoughtful and above and beyond. Kudos to the staff! I ate almost all my meals here, and was very impressed by the food. The cons: when I checked in they told me they could not find my reservation (I was part of the group). People spell my last name wrong a lot so I asked them to check that as well and she said that it was not listed under the incorrect spelling either. I wound up having to go to another hotel because the hotel was booked which was very inconvenient. Turns out they did have my last name spelled wrong, and the front desk clerk must not have checked throughly or cared. The next day I found out they had me listed as a no-show. All the other employees I met were super friendly helpful and thoughtful. I was able to check in the second night as another group had left and my company figured out the error. Since the rooms face the atrium, it can be a bit noisy especially if there's a function downstairs.Overall, I would stay here again, just the check in process was disappointing and made things very inconvenient for me for the first day I was in Atlanta for my conference. I am so sorry for the error in finding your reservation. I will share your feedback with my team and appreciate you taking the time.\n",

The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY.

The people are friendly, there is a lot to experience, and the kids (3 ages 8 to 16) were never bored. The 2 younger ones found instant friends. We did so much that we were all wiped out every night by 8:30. The concierge staff was great at finding us the best deals. One of the things offered was a photography session with Blink. It wasnt on the top of my activity lists, but we hadnt done it in awhile and I knew we might get a holiday card out of it. Tiffany made it fun, quick, and easy. And the pictures came out great. The concierge also booked us a last minute helicopter trip with Sunshine Helicopters to Molokai at a rate that was well below the published rate. We chose them because the price listed didnt have any fuel surcharge* like the others. Snorkeling at Molokini was awesome. Overall, the resorts food, staff, facilities and location are all top-notch. The shuttle service between the Starwood properties and Lahaina is a huge plus. Aloha dencoderek,Thank you for your review.

The rooms were spacious and clean, and looked recently renovated. I'd recommend this hotel anytime, especially for the price.\n",

            " Arriving into San Diego, GPS has me going down this scrappy looking strip dotted with low-end motels, convenience and liquor stores. Right away, I am chiding myself for relying only on T.A. and not talking with locals before booking the non-refundable special here. By the neighborhood's appearance I was certain I'd erred. The Pearl's unassuming exterior belies the treasures within. Upon walking into the courtyard/pool area, I met two cute and perky young gals at front desk who introduced me to Greg, the owner. I know I had a dubious look on my face as I began to question him about the clientele here, the noise level, the neighborhood, etc. Greg assured me this was a popular locals place for bar/dining, a favorite lodging place for an older crowd and young families, and not a wild partying venue. While he could have said, you will LOVE this place instead he was matter of fact, polite and reassuring. Upon entering the room, I knew I'd hit the jackpot....and within 5 minutes I found Greg at poolside with his co-workers, as I exclaimed, I LOVE this place! The room's retro dcor, cleanliness, ultra-modern touches and amenities set the stage for the ultimate in mid-century motif - right down to Jaws the lone fish swimming in a bowl mounted to the wall. At 4-6 Happy Hour, the relaxed and festive bar came alive with such friendly patrons and accommodating, crisp hotel staff. Between the hum of the AC and an incredibly comfortable bed, both nights of sleep were blissful. The restaurant is divine. I sat on the shag-covered pad by the lobby with a tray table as it was full for Valentine's prix fixe dinner. Service and food were superb. The feeling of pride among the staff in the care of the Pearl and its guests is palpable. While the location is a bit inconvenient to downtown, Point Loma is close by for spectacular views, and after a day of Balboa Park and sites in the city, it is a welcome retreat to return here. So, I will ONLY book at the Pearl on subsequent SD trips and sing its praises to anyone I know heading this way for holiday.\n",

            " I read other reviews after my husband had done research and made reservations at the Michigan Ave Comfort Suites. Now that I've spent two nights there, I can tell new readers what to believe.The good: 1. The location is excellent. Close to El stations, downtown shopping, the river, and the park. There are good restaurants nearby, like Sweetwater, as well as a couple of fast food places. And if you need something for your mosquito bites, Walgreen's is also very close. But if you want any groceries for the little kitchenette in your room you will have to either bring them with you or find City Groceries about three blocks away.2. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Ask them anything--they just want to please.3. The suites are quiet and have a bedroom with a very comfy bed, t.v., washer/dryer, as well as a living room and kitchen with a t.v. It felt like a little apartment. There are lots of windows, but not all of them have a great view many of them look on to other buildings.The not so good: 1. ELEVATORS. There are only two VERY SMALL elevators for 26 floors, and during our stay one of them was out of service. About 25 of the time, the elevator was too full and we had to wait (and wait!) for it to come back. This can really slow you down. Of course, there are stairs, so if you're fit and on a low enough floor, this might not be an issue.2. BREAKFAST. Comfort Suites offers a free continental breakfast that is quite mediocre. Poor quality (cheap) sandwich bread for toast, stale donuts, bagels, and pastries, cereal, waffles, sausage links, scrambled egg patties, juices, coffee, and fruit (only apples and bananas). It's a busy place in the morning and it's over at 9:00 am.So, in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and I can recommend this hotel with this advice: 1. Ask for a room on one of the lower floors, and 2. If a tasty breakfast is important to you, do some research and find a good restaurant.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience. We cannot thank you enough for your understanding and patience during the elevator issue we experienced. We certainly try to put our best foot forward and apologize for this inconvenience during your stay. We apologize that the breakfast offerings did not meet your expectations. We would certainly be delighted to have another opportunity to have you with us and experience a flawless stay.

            " Upon my arrival here and stay for the night on a business trip I checked out this place online to see my value and what it had to offer for me. Walking into this place I was greeted with such respect and helpful people. I was very impressed with the lay out mostly the front door takes you right in front of the elevator so that I don' have to walk around to find my room or look for the elevators to take me up to the 6th floor. Once in the room I was very impressed with the mattress set they had to offer. Taking me to a deep and very comfy sleep. If there is one thing that I like to make sure hotels have to offer me is to have full 4G cell phone coverage on all floors, so that I can stay connected with my business partners and family while on the road. I have noticed in certain locations I did not have my full strength coverage as needed. This could be a very big improvement for any type of guest that may raise their customer experience while staying here.Thank you so much for your feedback, it really helps us understand what is working well and where we have opportunity. I will look into the cell phone strength and see what we can do to ensure we offer the best connection. We look forward to seeing you back with us soon!\n",

            " The Pearl is an extremely unique place. I do want to counter a few statements from post-reviews about the outdated feel and the ikea like furniture. It's very understandable for someone to not feel that The Pearl is up to date. The architecture of the building is old, yes, and the furniture, yes, but that's the idea behind the movement of this hotel. Seldom these days do you find such a gem that supports and honors the art of MCM. The whole idea is to feel that your living in a 1950-60's dwell magazine ad. Playing episodes of soul train in the courtyard should sell anyone. Good on you folks at The Pearl for keeping the beauty of MCM alive. The Restaurant was incredible, and the support of local and sustainable, is a breathe of fresh air. The staff are charming, funny, and all good looking. Thank you!

            " I spent one night in Aloft in a business trip. The hotel is in a central location in downtown Atlanta. The price is very good. The heavy concrete look is predominant at the lobby area, which I didn't like. The room was fine and had everything I need in a room. I asked about dinner at the front desk when I checked in and they told me that I can either eat at their lobby bar or order from one (only one!) restaurant they would allow in so I should look at the menu in my room. There was no menu in the room. I called the front desk and when they finally were persuaded that I don't have that book with a white cover in my room they said they will send someone with the menu. I am still waiting... The next night I stayed at the W hotel. I paid 25 more and got much more... Aloft would not be high on my list next time I travel to Atlanta.Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Aloft Atlanta Downtown.

As Hilton Honors members with experience of this chain throughout the Eastern Seaboard, I cannot give highest marks. This is the second Florida property which has provided plastic utensils and foam plates unworthy of guests and the vaunted Hilton green promise. Maybe it is owned by the same franchise consortium which provided the same tepid and unhealthy dinners to us last year. The second which had a surly dining 'overseer' around whom staff worked circles. She actually crowed that she never eats off stainless flatware because only plastic is clean. She continued to spout to the next guest after I opted not to engage her. The worker bees were really working hard and efficiently, but queen bee of dining needs to buzz off.\n",

The pool gets a lot of sun in the morning which is nice for sipping coffee by or if it is warm enough a dip. The pool was heated where we didn't mind swimming in it even when the temp didn't get above 70. Breakfast was better than I expected. The eggs were actually scrambled not like the weird omelet I had before at a budget motel. We always had enough at breakfast to carry us through at least the next cuban sandwich shop. I used the gym there which was ok a few cardio machines including an elliptical and free weights and exercise balls. The nice thing was I was the only one in there both times I used it.

Breakfast was superb even with full house during a football weekend. Would surely return.

If noise bothers you, specify a quiet room at the rear and in from the side road (Franklin).There are MUCH larger , updated rooms, and some very cramped scruffy rooms. (We are talking can't swing a cat.) Specify a larger updated room when booking, it costs the same.The breakfast in the tiny lobby has instant coffee and a few muffins and pastries, keeps the wolf from the door.

We were put in the horrid, cramped, noisy room first night and made a fuss til we were moved to a MUCH better, way quieter room. No excuse for this since we had booked it months in advance, and because of the reviews had ASKED in writing for a quiet room, off the road.Free parking.

            " I was looking forward to giving this hotel an amazing review, but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work, but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610,Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay.

The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. I'm also concerned that the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are not properly secured. I feel like someone had contaminated the shampoo, as it had a terrible smell, which unfortunately I did not discover until after I had it in my hair.

Problem was that the front desk attendant literally just handed me the keys and said have a nice stay. no explanation of the amenities, no mention of restaurants or any festivities for the new year. Didn't ask if i had parked onsite. Didn't offer instruction to elevator or where my room was located - it was VERY odd. not a great way to start our stay. After we walked away - both my husband and I were taken aback by how unfriendly the woman was and that we had no idea where to go to find our room.We did find our room - and it was nice. nothing amazing or crazy - but nice. We had a room with view of the braves stadium - which worked out well because they had fireworks that night for NYE.With the hotel being a Renaissance - I just expected more. maybe if you had an event or convention at the hotel - it would be nicer to be there. But for a night away with your spouse - it was completely lackluster. There are so many hotels in ATL - we will definitely be trying out somewhere else next time we visit.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

It seems as though rooms that are further from the pool are larger and have double sinks in the bathroom. Kind of motel style property with no indoor air conditioned hallways. The only bad thing about this hotel is that there is no shuttle into town so a rental car or some other mode of transport is a must. Staff was extremely friendly. Hopefully the maintenance staff can keep this property in good shape in the years to come.Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed your visit.

I, too, was suckered by the glowing reviews, but in reality, this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town, and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls, making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar, which unfortunately is in an open courtyard, which means you get to hear the music all night, whether you want to or not.

For some reason one of the car parks was shut (think they were decorating) There were only 2 disabled spaces left so we went and asked where to park. The guy at the front desk was very unhelpful, but told us to park in the shaded area in a tight corner. We did as we were told, but felt uneasy about this. The next day 2 cars had completely blocked us in, good job we weren't needing the car until the next day. Thank goodness that the other car park appeared to open that day as we were no longer blocked in. Check-in was OK- the guy seemed disinterested and had no customer service skills whatsoever. He obviously did not want to be there. Not a good start to our San Fan.Our room was OK- dated but relatively clean and comfortable. The location was good right on Lombard street and 10 minutes walk from Fishermans wharf. Was good that we could have coffee or orange juice and some pastries in the foyer for breakfast. Very basic but did the job. We had an OK stay in the end, but they could make the hotel so much better with some improvements and if they hired staff who actually care then that would make the experience so much better for us!\n",

The atrium is quite impressive and sometimes generates noise (one of the few negative points) but the meeting infrastructure, the rooms itself, the restaurant (Medici and Tosca Blu), the spa and fitness, swimming pool, easy access to Cumberland mall...(should I go on) make this property one of the best business hotels in the neighbourhood. Best is of course in a renovated room and with your access to the lounge but that will depend on you.

The director of sales (Patrick) and sales manager (Kristina) went over and above to make sure that my stay was the best it could be. I was upgraded to a 2 BR suite and they bought me tickets to a Cubs game (which I reimbursed them). Their willingness to help plan my days were unparalleled.This hotel is a tremendous value, considering its ideal location on Michigan Avenue and its price which includes a small breakfast.

            " Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean\n",

I thought it was just okay, picked it for price compared to other hotels in the area.Pros:Spacious room (would be a studio if this were an apt)Great location, steps away from the Boston Public Garden, Newberry St, etcGood value, given location and sizeCons:Kinda shabby (not chic): I guess this might pass as quaint victorian to some but it could use a little shine. Everything creaked. By which I mean every single step up and down the stairs, and in my room, and every time I rolled over in bed (which was 2 singles pushed together to make a king).Both:Plumbing: on the plus side, great rainfall showerhead, modern toilet and sink. On the minus side, the shower seemed to have two temps, really hot and even hotter and while the sink fixtures seemed stable, the hardware parts unseen shuddered every time I turned the water on.Breakfast: plentiful, chobani yogurts. But otherwise pedestrian (grocery store breads/bagels/cereal/granola), grape jelly, under-ripe cantalope/honeydew fruit cup, hardboiled eggs.As a solo female traveler who arrived after hours, I would suggest to management putting people's initials or reservation on the envelope with keys that's left in the foyer, rather than writing out guest's names.\n",

This was a good size for 2 people. The only issue I had is the drapes. They had regular drapes that only covered half of the window, and a sheer drape that covered the whole window. The problem is at night, there was always light shinning through the window. Not the easiest to get to sleep. The pool and pool area were very nice, they had cabanas and plenty of seating areas.We enjoyed the free breakfast, something for everyone. They had scrambled eggs (which I think were powdered), hard boiled eggs, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, cereals, breads, english muffins, muffins, yogart, bagels, fresh fruit and fruit salad. Went back for numerous servings.There was free wi-fi, however they try repeatedly to have you upgrade to a faster speed (for a fee of course).As far as location, you should either have a car so you can get to the beach or other attractions, or be prepared to catch the trolley or taxi.

            " If you're looking for a vacation on the beach, I recommend this hotel. Gated underground parking (10/day), friendly front desk staff, 1 minute walk from your room to the beach. Right on the boardwalk, so whether you're looking for ice cream and a hotdog or a sit-down dinner after a day at the beach, it's all within walking distance. Forgot sunscreen, sunglasses, etc There are shops right on the board walk for that. Forgot toiletries, etc There's a CVS right behind the hotel. While the decor wasn't fancy, the hotel was always clean. The bathrooms were updated: walk-in, glass-doored, tiled showers and very large vanities, plenty of room for a family to spread out. Beds were so-so soft but not the most comfortable. If you're willing to pay premium, stay in the ocean-front rooms. We loved sitting on the balcony at night, people-watching and listening to the waves. You can hear the waves from the rooms with the sliding glass doors or windows open, but it's actually very quiet with them closed. We did stay on the north-end of the hotel, so I can't speak for the south-end where there are some restaurants/bars right next door that get loud at night/on weekends.You can also walk pretty much anywhere in Pacific Beach from here shopping, restaurants, etc. I recommend The Mission (in Mission Beach) and Leilani's Cafe for breakfast. Each is about a 15-20 mins walk from the hotel.Overall, happy with our stay, and we would stay again!Thank you for taking the time to provide our prospective guests with some great tips.

Probably the smallest double room weve stayed in so we had to be organised as we had 2 ski bags and 3 suitcases meaning space was limited. The bathroom however, was quite roomy!

The air con was powerful but noisy. The pool was small but good for a city hotel and never too busy (we used it a fair amount). The hotel is huge though so I feel they were not at full occupancy. Location was excellent- just across the road from the old town. It was also a 10 minute walk from the trolley/ tram system which easily could take you to the centre of town, 5 for a day pass. We arrived at 10am and they were able to give us a room at midday which was nice. We were in block 8 which was just above the carpark. While convenient, most of the other blocks were in much nicer locations, some rooms with views. I dont know if they were different price as Im sure we had the cheapest option. At check in we were given some 20 off vouchers for the hotel restaurant and a free drink voucher which we used once and was quite nice.Thank you for taking the time to sharing your experience with us!Sounds like you had a great summer getaway.

            " Being both a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member and Hilton HHonors Diamond for me means that I spend over 200 nights a year in hotels, it has also given me a keen insight into what makes for a perfect hotel stay. Unfortunately the Renaissance Waverly Hotel in Atlanta falls short of delivering even an acceptable hotel stay. When I arrived at the hotel there was no bellman available to assist me with luggage. There was a line at check in with only two people at the front desk. The line moved slowly but when my turn came I was greeted nicely and welcomed as a Platinum Elite. I was also grated my requested upgrade. The suite that I had was nice although the furnishings and carpet were heavily worn. The table in the room had terrible scuffs and was made worse by an attempted cover up with magic markers. The carpeting beside the windows was fraying terribly, the robe that was in the closet was pilling to such a bad extent, it should have been thrown out! I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to look at the problems but no one ever came. One afternoon I asked for the shuttle to take me to a nearby establishment but when the shuttle van driver looked up the address I was told it was zero point two 0.2 mikes further than the 3 mile radius and despite not being busy at all, my request was refused. Instead I was pointed in the direction of a cab and told I had to pay myself if I wanted to go there. All in all it just seemed the entire staff were too busy doing nothing and were simply counting the hours until they were off. On day of checkout I informed the manager on duty of all my issues and as compensation I was offered 10,000 reward points. It's now been two months and I am still waiting for those points. The Cobb Galleria area is now more popular than ever due to the opening of the new stadium, and while this hotel is definitely very close by, there are many other hotels equally close that are far better choices for anyone coming to this area.\n",

Like the fish that came with our room, Rambo. The bar is open to the pool, everything is small, but the whole hotel is small. The location was close to everything needed, coffee etc. Even though the area is older and feels more real, it felt safe. If you want to party with other hotel guests there are planned events around the bar and on Wednesday nights a dive-in movie.Cons - Our shower was very sad, to get hot water we ended up with not much more than a trickle. The flip side of the activities around the pool is the noise level which blended in with our extremely noisy air conditioner. Overall we were glad that we stayed. Our check-in was done by Megan who was lovely,warm and welcoming.Thank you for taking the time to write a mighty fine review. Feedback is so important to us.

            " Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel.\n",

Got to room and lights didnt work, patio door was a nightmare to open. to mini frig, very poor service in diner, room was almost alive with smells and dirt. We stayed from Sun to Wed. now the diner service was very bad but had 30 daily for food and was not going to let it go to waste. But the wait was long and slow. Staff seemed to be more interested in texting or smoking or anything but service. Housekeeping seemed to be doing best they could with available supplies. Seen floor cleaner sitting in hall on 1st floor for almost 24 hours. The bed itself was not to bad. Always go on trips with my own pillows as i hate the ones in hotels. Internet was worse than dial up.

We had 2 suites (one bedroom suite for my husband and I and a two bedroom suite for son and his wife and 4 children). The 2 bedroom suite was a generous size for the family of six. The one bedroom suite was very nice with a door separating the bedroom from the living/kitchen space. The rooms were neat and clean. We never experienced any problems with housekeeping. The kitchen was fully stocked and had a full size fridge. Plently of room for snacks and drinks. The weather was a little chilly while we were there so the pool was only used one afternoon. But it was well maintained. The staff was very pleasant. The breakfast was fine. We did not partake in the evening menu so we cannot comment. But it was nice to have that option. The location was close to the Disney Parks and other attractions. We would return to this hotel again.\n",

            " I try to stay at Rex Hotel whenever I am in San Francisco for business, which is every few months. The hotel definitely has character. The location is hard to beat as well. Since San Francisco is not densely populated, I recommend staying in Union Square area since it is always lively even late in the evening. On the other hand hotels towards Tenderloin area would not be a good choice if you like to take a walk around. Rex Hotel is on Sutter Street which is close enough to Union Square but far enough from Tenderloin.I like to order breakfast in my room. It also serves as a wake up call. Wireless internet in the room works decent enough. Did not slow down during the evening where many people connect to it.I only stayed as single person in their room.

            " My wife, brother-in-law and I spent four nights in a two-room family suite on the second floor, looking over Columbus Avenue, with views of Coit Tower and Alcatraz. It was very quiet in the motel: we couldn't hear people in the next room, although there was some noise from the street. Rates were low for SF - we paid 135/night for a two-room suite. Our rooms were clean, spacious, smoke free, and looked recently decorated with new carpets. The furniture was solid and the beds were comfortable. The motel is centrally located - an easy walk from Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach, both with plenty of shops and restaurants. It was one block from the Powell-Mason Street cable car terminus and bus number 30 stopped right outside the motel. We bought the 3-day MUNI pass, and went everywhere by cable car, streetcar and bus. The front desk staff were helpful, helped us to find places to eat, gave directions, and booked the shuttle bus to the airport. We had breakfast each day at Pat's Cafe, 2 minutes walk away, and can highly recommend it.\n",

I was not there at check-in, but it must have gone smoothly since my husband did it alone with all the kids while I was at a meeting and didn't complain!The kids enjoyed the indoor pool. However, the key did not work at first to get into the pool, requiring my husband to trek across the hotel and lobby with everyone in their swimsuits to get a new keycard.The room service was good, but I would have liked more choices, especially on the late night menu. And make sure to ask about a kids entree choices and prices, since they are not printed on the room service menu.Our room on the 14th floor was large and had 2 queen beds, a desk and chair, and a nice lounge chair. There was a good view, too!We got a good AAA rate of 99 a night.The only problem I had was with the billing, but it was fixed. We had to change our reservation to 1 night instead of 2. The bill I got had charged us as a no show for the first night, even though I had changed the reservation online in plenty of time. Also, there was a 9.95 internet fee that we didn't use. Both charges were taken off the bill, but it was still a hastle to have to address it at all.I would stay here again if I could get the same rate.

Quick with extra towels, etc. can't say enough to about this location!!! Full size shampoo/conditioner/shower gel in shower. Great restaurant attached to the hotel. We also revived a little bag upon Checkin with two bottle of voss water, some snacks and a bottle of wine. Everything we needed to get settled! Valet was available for 60 a day (comparable to others in the area) we parked the car and used public transportation the entire weekend. I would have no problems recommended! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!\n",

            " We had sat down to plan a trip to San Diego... We had planned 5 days in San Diego.. We looked at hotels and motels by the beach. We quickly decided staying on the beach was super super pricey. This Best western worked out great. Although it is not on the beach, it is an easy 6 min drive from the beach. 6 min drive to old town San Diego as well. The breakfast had a great variety! I am gluten free and generally have limited options. This breakfast offered eggs, bacon, fruit and yogurt. They also offered a variety of other items as well waffles and breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. It can be a bit of a noisy place( to no fault to the hotel) Kids can be a bit rowdy lol The pool was so fantastic! We enjoyed it almost everyday. The room was clean and spacious as well. Parking was super convenient WE would definitely stay here again..Good Morning,Thank you so much for your compliments to our hotel. It is wonderful to know you were happy with your stay and location. Our hotel is very centralized which is just within minutes to most location like beaches, park, Sea World and many more other attractions.When you return to San Diego, please feel free to contact me directly for all of your reservation needs.

            " Our four person family - 2 adults and 2 kids, stayed here for a 4th of July staycation to be near the fireworks and Millenium Park. We were initially underwhelmed entering the small, dark lobby and small elevators- but wow, the rooms are fantastic! We had a light-filled king suite, with a full kitchen, spacious bathroom, living room and a lovely balcony! The service was very good the entire time- coffee at the (free!) breakfast was pretty good, the wifi worked and the beds were comfortable. The price was right, even on a busy 4th of July holiday, and the location is very convenient for Millenium Park/ Lakefront activities, as well as walking distance to the art museum, water taxis, or Michigan Ave shopping. This hotel is hands down the best value in the city.Dear jennifertF2691OZ,Thank you for your recent 5 star review. I am so thrilled that you enjoyed your stay!

Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.We appreciate the feedback jerryg, to make your next Seattle visit as convenient as possible I would be happy to connect you to our W Insider who can assist with local arrangements.

It was quite noisy until late at night and difficult to get on an elevator. That aside, the location is good, the rooms are large, and the service was fine. We did have a problem with the heat/AC, however. It either blasted heat or turned the room into an ice box, nothing in between. Overall, a decent hotel but we won't be rushing back.\n",

We arrived after getting the Bart from the airport to union square then walking a couple of blocks to hotel at around 5.15 and was checked into our room straight away by very nice and helpful staff the porter guy took our bags for us and showed us to our room and mentioned the wine hour in the bat that goes on every night 5-6 pm which was great. The room was comfy and big enough for us with a good shower. Our view wasn't the best but it didn't really bother us a we were only using room to crash at night after adventuring around. Noise from outside was fine too. Could sleep perfectly well. The food in the restaurant looked good we had breakfast one morning which was tasty and priced well. Hotel is in a great location for shopping and sightseeing catching the trams to fisherman's wharf just perfect stay to our trip with everyone we can across to be friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back when in San Francisco again. JimmyD23,Wow - 3 weeks across California! Sounds like a great trip. Thank you for stopping by the Rex during this adventure.

            " I've grown to like this chain alot. Nicest breakfast around, included in the pricetag. As with alot of Orlando hotels, though, this one has way too many kids, and there was NO room for many folks to sit during the height of b'fast hours. The other concern I had was the lack of decent running nearby, but that's endemic to the area, not specific to the hotel. The room was fine, however, and no issues at all with any of the staff. I rank this one below the one in which I stayed the previous night near the Albany, NY airport. That one was superior, both in terms of the breakfast seating, breakfast selection, and the overall condition of the property (also fewer kids!) Running there was also better.\n",

The hotel is convenient to the highway but there's really nothing else around the property.The property is modern and fairly clean. The room was nicely made up and had some useful amenities like a fridge, microwave, and sink. The TV and wifi worked well. Unfortunately, the free popcorn ends up on the floors in the elevator and and the carpet in the hallways which looks messy.

            " Nice hotel. Chinatown 10metres away. rooms clean and tidy. comfortable. Reception really obliging and polite an friendly. Only concern was a sign that was in an obscure place stating it was a health hazard staying at this hotel and that it could cause cancer. upon asking receptionist what this was about - she didnt know!! We found this on checking out - so a little advice to the Orchard Garden Hotel - if there is not health hazard - remove that bloody sign - if there is - then we should know about it BEFORE we book so we can make an informed decision.Thank you so much for sharing your experience with the Orchard Garden Hotel. Although I am delighted to read the property was to your liking, I am so very sorry regarding the confusion behind the warning sign. I will make sure everyone at the front desk knows where the pamphlets are explaining the details.In 1986 California voters approved an initiative (proposition 65) to address their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. The Office of Environmental Hazard Assessment requires all businesses to notify patrons of such toxins. They have put together a list that contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that can harm people. Some of the chemicals listed are additives or ingredients in pesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes or solvents. Listed chemicals may be used in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.As a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified hotel we really dont use many chemicals at all, but we still have the sign to be compliant. We pride ourselves as a smoke free hotel. Our housekeepers use green seal certified cleaning products, which are just as effective as harsh traditional cleaners. Rooms and halls are fitted with 2 recycled carpeting that sets off a low V.O.C (volatile organic compound) and 100 recycled padding under the carpet. All fabrics are made with recycled polyester and other textiles without chemicals and are machine-washed to avoid the chemicals that come with dry cleaning. Although the food provided in the restaurant is organic from local farms, needless to say the liquor served at the bar can be harmful to someone pregnant. I hope you find comfort in this brief explanation. If you like I would be more than happy to send you more information regarding OEHHA and Proposition 65. All of us here would be elated to have you stay with us again hopefully you can choose us without hesitation.Kind regards,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager\n",

OK,for those who like boutique places,then this will not do,but for a large family group,nine in our case,all of whom like their food and drink,and appreciate clean,comfy rooms,then it's hard to beat. The rooms are spotlessly clean,and the breakfast in the lounge is more than adequate,as are the pm snacks. There was never a problem finding a seat,nor the 3 car parking slots we needed. The same goes for the pool loungers,and the pool/spa area was fine,tidy and convenient. Compare this to a number of places we've been over the years,where seats,car spaces and pool space was a mad scramble each night.

            " I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation.

            " Located on a hillside overlooking Old Town San Diego, the Best Western Plus Hacienda has charm but has a rather quirky layout. It used to be a shopping center and has several levels and elevators that sometimes don't work. Be prepared to walk lots of stairs especially if you're in Building 6 like we were. I booked a room with a two queens and a sofa sleeper for our family of five but when we got to our room in Building 4 there was no sofa sleeper. We headed back down to the lobby and the front desk clerk asked, Are you sure We had to laugh at that. Another staff member offered to show us two other room choices. She walked us around to the rooms and was very courteous and professional. Our luggage was moved from the old room to the new room in Building 6 quickly and efficiently. The parking area for Building 6 is very small and fills up early in the evening. The parking spaces themselves are impossibly narrow and hard to get out of. The local channels on our TV were awfully static and hard to watch while the cable stations came in clear. But in spite of all that, our room was clean, comfortable and spacious enough for our family. Old Town is a great area to stay in with lots of restaurants, museums and things to explore. Plus it is centrally located...less than 10 - 15 minutes to Downtown, Balboa Park, La Jolla Cove and the Airport. Good stay, great location!Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! I apologize the room didnt have the sofa sleeper as expected, but Im very happy to hear one of our staff members went the extra mile to remedy the situation and get you into a room suited nicely for your family!

The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan\n",

            " Stayed here for 3 nights and were very satisfied. The price was fair even with the extra 48 a night for parking. Location was excellent as it was close to bus stops and centrally located to most everything you would want to go and see. Staff was very helpful and polite. The only thing I would say is the breakfast was a little lame even for the choice hotel line. All three mornings we went for breakfast the food was either cold or not there at all. No butter, coffee was never full, bread items ran out and were not refilled promptly. If they could fix the breakfast problems they would get 5 stars from me.Dear Joseph P,Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your experience with us. We are very glad you enjoyed your stay.I am sorry that you did not have a great breakfast experience. I will bring your issue up with my team and make sure to correct them.We look forward to your returning again on the futureRobert HumphreyGeneral Manager\n",

            " My boyfriend and I just returned from The Chelsea after our stay on Saturday the 12th. We are both local (we both live in Absecon, 10 minutes outside of Atlantic City). Since we live so close, we rarely splurge and spend the on a room for one evening. This year we wanted to celebrate Valentine's day with a special treat. Our friend Eddie, an employee of the Chelsea, suggested spending a night there. We looked online and were really excited by the photos. We appreciated the art deco decor and throwback feel of the hotel. When we checked in, the front desk employee informed us that we would be in the Annex portion of the hotel. Our room was A DISASTER!! Main lamp was broken, shower mat was filthy, shower head completely off the wall, tv did not work, the toilet did not fliush and the room WAS NOTHING LIKE what was portrayed on the website. When we went to the front desk, the manager said there was nothing they could do about the room or the toilet. He said he would comp our breakfast the next morning. We found out later that the Annex portion of the hotel was being gutted next week. That is all well and good, but this should have been made clear when the reservation was made. Its a shame that locals get treated so poorly.\n",

            " We have been frequent guests at this hotel since it opened. The location is great if you want to be close to Downtown Disney and also I-Drive. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. The suites have clean, comfortable beds. The full kitchen is a plus for heating up leftovers or making light meals on the weekends. The suites have a separate bedroom, which is great for families. The bathrooms are the standard mini tub/shower combination. There is only one vanity, which is fortunately outside of the tub and toilet area. I really wish that hotels would do away with those ridiculous tubs and just put in showers for most of the rooms. The living room furniture is standard for all Homewood Suites. I don't think the buyer ever had to sit on the couch or chair. All of the furniture is very rigid and quickly becomes uncomfortable. On a positive note, there is a tray on the ottoman that you can use to bring food up to the room from the reception area. Pros- location, staff, consistent Hilton service, adequate breakfastCons- no evening meals Friday- Sunday, living furniture is very uncomfortable. Overall, if you are in the area, you can't go wrong with this property.\n",

This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork.

            " We recently stayed for 7 nights and had 2 children and a baby within our group. Let's get the elevator problem out of the way, it is a problem, but nothing to stop you staying here. The building should have had 3 elevators in its design, but it hasn't, so it is what it is. I personally didn't have to wait any longer than 5 minutes for the elevator and this was including a 24 hour period where one elevator was out of service. If you can plan to leave for the day straight after breakfast it helps. Also, if people didn't hit up and down when they were in fact wanting to go down, this just slows the elevator for everyone. The staff were really friendly and always greeted us with a smile. There was cold lemonade put out most days. The breakfast was excellent and saved us a fortune, the one day we did eat out for breakfast it cost 50 for the 4 of us, so I essentially saved 300. Location wise, 5 minute walk to Times Square and 10 minutes to Empire State. We used the Subway entrance on 40th/8th which was a 3 minute walk. Good basic hotel with decent free breakfast and friendly staff.Mr. Cochrane,Wed like to thank you and your family for choosing to stay with us during your recent trip to NYC and for writing such a kind review of our hotel!

            " We've stayed at the JW Marriott Buckhead every year for the past 3 years, with our most recent stay December 2015. I must begin by saying that this is one of the cleanest hotel properties I've ever visited, and I travel quite frequently (approximately every 2 months). Not only is the service great, but everything from the lobby to Nox Creek and the guest rooms look and feel absolutely beautiful. Hotel aesthetics aside, the property itself is conveniently located in the middle of Buckhead, directly connected to Lenox Square Mall. Moreover, there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance that are outside of the mall. If you don't feel like walking or if the weather doesn't permit, one of the hotel's cars will take you to almost any restaurant within 2 miles of the property. I will most definitely return this year for our annual trip to ATL.\n",

            " I recently stayed at the Best Western Hacienda for the week, and I cannot rave enough about the great location of the hotel. Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as Excellent.The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego.I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...)We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.Overall, I think the hotel is a good value. The location is great and within walking distance of a lot of great sites. I probably would not recommend the hotel if you planned on staying indoors all day!\n",

            " We spent 3 nights at BW Plus Bayside Inn. Great location. Walkable to Seaport Village, The Midway, and Little Italy. Staff was super friendly and helpful with directions. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable. We slept very well. No problems at all. We could not hear other guests, the elevators ran smoothly and quickly, and parking was no problem. Definitely will stay again when we are in San Diego. Thank you for taking time to cover the details of your experience staying at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. We are grateful for your review of our friendly staff, our clean/comfortable quiet rooms. We are glad you slept well and found both the elevators and parking to be convenient! We look forward to welcoming you back.\n",

We each got a drink on the house. They reopened their restaurant with some new foods. I wasnt a fan, but Im a more casual eater, I didnt even know what somethings were. The decor is charming: a swan floaty in the pool, a vertical succulent garden, chiminea in the corner, twinkling lights, bamboo for privacy, Betta fish in every room. There were a couple snafus but they handled it nicely. Id go back.\n",

            " The biggest problem of this hotel is the location, the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general, rooms are very tiny, it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep, have shower and not more than this. So, If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights, it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed, that the district is full of homeless, hookers, drug dealers and junk. However, that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.\n",

            " The number one advantage of this hotel is the location. The fact that you can take MARTA from the airport, walk out of the Lenox station and be at the hotel is amazing. I used the convenient car service to get around the Buckhead area to where I was working. My favorite restaurant, Houston's, is conveniently across the street. It's also connected to Lenox Square, so it's perfect for finding the perfect gift for family at home. The staff was very friendly. When I arrived, they acknowledged by Gold status and upgraded me to a larger room on the Concierge level. The breakfast in the Concierge lounge was excellent, as was the service by the staff. The room was tastefully decorated, but a little bit too traditional for my taste. The bathroom was nice, but needs an upgrade. The bed was awesome, clean, and very comfortable.If I can get the same rate at this hotel again, I will definitely stay here again.\n",

We would freeze our water bottles the night before and our water would stay nice and cold until mid afternoon at the parks.Beds were comfortable clean. Sofa bed mattress was very thin and I did not think my 11year old would be comfortable but she did not complain. I do not think it would be comfy for and adult. Linens were clean upon arrival however when they were changed upon my request on the 3rd day I did notice some linens towels were a little dingy NOT dirty but dingy (I think if they look like that they should be thrown away and replaced)Upon arrival the room appeared clean however the bathroom dresser drawers were dusty and had hair in them. I cleaned them out and used paper towels to line them before putting our belongings in them.It did not appear that housekeeping vacuumed,swept or mopped our entire stay.The floors in and outside of elevators were not cleaned regularly either(one morning there was a sticky spill outside the main elevator when we left early in the morning it was still there when we arrived back at the hotel late that evening.Breakfast was decent for about 2 days then you do not want it anymore because its repetitive. I have read complaints about a worker being rude during breakfast hours. I experienced that myself I said hello twice to this man then a 3rd to see if he was for real and he totally ignored me,I also heard him actually reprimand a guest for not understanding how to use the cereal dispenser. The manager really needs to discuss proper etiquette to him or find another position for him because no one deserves to start their morning with that kind of disrespect however there is another gentleman who works during this time also he works his tail off and he is so super nice and deserves a raise )The pool was nice.The hot tub when we stayed smelled and looked very dirty.I wish there was designated smoking area enforced also.It is awful when you do not smoke and to have to sit around it and walk through it.The hotel is right off I-4 and Disney is one exit from the hotel makes for a great location!There are several restaurants around the hotel to choose from.Despite minor quirks I would stay here again!

Walking was a pleasure in San Diegos fantastic weather, especially at this hotels location on the coast. I found two car rental companies nearby with hotel pick-up but we didnt need them. Instead, we took advantage of the bus stops one or two blocks away for travel to attractions around town.The room was clean and comfortable. The desk and free wi-fi were handy when I used the public transportation Trip Planner on the SDMTS website. We slept with the balcony door open to get the ocean breeze and the soft soothing sound of the waves. The complimentary breakfast has ample choices. I recommend trying the self-serve waffle maker. We remedied the lack of fruit with a two-block walk to the local supermarket, storing the perishables in our hotel rooms refrigerator. The staff at the desk were always there and ready to be helpful, a plus since this was my first time in San Diego.

Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down\n",

From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable.

            " After reading a number of reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. The hotel itself is a motel. The staff that we experienced were all good and helpful. The Inn does sit at a busy intersection but with the A/C unit on in the room we heard very little through the night. We did face Lomard Street. The room was big with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. These would come in handy as I would not consider the continental breakfast provided to be substantial by any means. However, it was something in the morning before leaving and finding some real food. The bathroom was big and clean though it could have used a couple of more towels. There was no problem having hot water for our showers in the morning. The linens were clean. The bed could have been more comfortable for our liking but we are all different and expect different things from our beds.Not being familiar with the lay of the land we took the info provided of others indicating it was only a 15 minute walk to the pier 39 and also used this in our decision to stay here. The location for being central is great. YOu are no more than 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. If you walk the other way you are about the same to Crissy Field and the Presidio. The World's Crookedest Street is about 4 uphill blocks away. Getting to here from the airport was uneventful and quite easy. The neighbourhood it is in is safe by our standards and we did not feel uncomfortable walking back from the pier alter in the evening. There are some wonderful restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood as well no more than a 10 minute walk in the direction of the Presidio on Chestnut.The free parking and internet were also added benefits considering the cost of parking in some areas and other hotels in San Francisco.With all this said it is not the greatest nor is it the worst. For the money we paid in San Francisco it did provide value for our dollar. As others have stated if you want upscale you will pay for it but this is not that place.\n",

            " As seasons ticket holders for the Seattle Seahawks, we typically drive down from Vancouver then drive back up after the game. This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay. Thanks W Seattle...and Go Seahawks.WOW, what a fabulous review, and I am thrilled that we were able to make it special for you both! And we agree, Mykaela IS amazing, and we are thrilled to have her on our team! We appreciate you staying at W Seattle, and we hope to see you back next time you are in the city!

            " The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well.

            " I have recently returned from a 5 day stay in Holiday Inn Express New York Times Square. The hotel is very basic and unless all you want the room for is to sleep then do not stay here.We arrived at the hotel and greeted by the reception team who were very pleasant and helpful. We were given rooms 2001, 2004 and 2006 which were on the 20th floor. The rooms were very small but were clean. Our air conditioning was not working but was fixed once reported to reception. Our beds were not changed once on our visit, also where I made the bed in the morning just to make the room tidy, the housekeeping never actually fixed the bed. They advise you use the same towels rather than them having to keep changing them but when requested clean towels they would happily bring you some.The hotel has around 132 rooms and only 2 lifts that can hold up to 6-8 people so waiting for the lift especially breakfast time could be frustrating. The breakfast room is tiny considering how many people are in the hotel. Breakfast is mainly muffins, bagels and pastries, this was ok but after 5 days it became very repetitive and quite sickly.When booking this hotel as it said Times Square I thought I would actually be in time square but its is a good 10 15 minutes walk away.Hotel is average and I do not think I would stay here againThank you very much for sharing your honest and candid feedback with us. We are disappointed in ourselves for letting you leave our hotel with an OK impression of your stay. Here at the Holiday Inn Express Times Square, we pride ourselves in providing the best customer service and value despite the challenges we face being located in Midtown Manhattan. Thank you for your comments and suggestions as we value our guests opinions and utilize their feedback to improve our services and better train our staff.

The room was small but adequate with a balcony, fridge, comfortable bedding and beds. We also had a limited bay view. While there is a lot of construction going on, it was not distracting.Breakfast was in a restaurant down the street from the hotel. Hot and cold choices were plentiful and the service excellent.My only complaint is the condition of the carpet. It was very stained and really should be replaced (room 609).Thank you for choosing to stay with us while visiting San Diego! It is great to learn about your stay and how much you enjoyed the area. Thank you for letting us know about the carpet in your room so we may address it and we appreciate your feedback about the easy and quick check in.

Everyone was very nice and efficient. The hotel had only been open one week when we visited. We were the first ones to use the room! Nice pool area. Great complimentary breakfast. Plenty of parking and on a major street that makes it easy to get between the Old and New Towns of Key West. We stayed mid week for 180 including taxes. Everyplace else on the web for mid week was 235 and older. This entire area is under construction and going to be part of a Keys Collection theme with more hotels and restaurants. Good place, great people, good value!Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed your visit. No need to stay elsewhere with Free Breakfast and plenty of Free Parking. The staff is excited to welcome you back on your next visit. Thanks for staying with us.\n",

It was far enough away from congestion, yet easy access to everything. Orlando Airport only 18 minutes away. The two room suite was perfect for our family. Their room service food (we had it twice) was better than most room service I receive when traveling. The hotel staff was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel for families on a budget looking to get the best value for their dollar.\n",

            " We stayed in the annex area of the Chelsea, which is the older area. I thought the rooms were good in size. We had 2 Queen beds with a balcony that overlooked the pool area. This area had some areas that needed work but overall was a cute place to stay at the end of the boardwalk. We ate at both the chelsea prime on the 5th floor and the diner style restaurant on the bottom level of the annex. Both were good, the prime was a bit over priced for the small portions of food we received. We tried the club area also on the 5th floor but because we got there pretty early in the night, there wasn't much going on. It was a nice large space I'd like to go back to if I am in AC again. They advertise a swim up bar, but neither pools have this. They are just both next to a bar. They had valet parking(extra charge), however, they lost our car and we were left waiting for 20 minutes until they found where they parked it.\n",

            " Stayed here for a few nights while in town for a trade show at the Cobb Galleria. This hotel has easy access to the Cobb Galleria as it is connected. The location of the hotel is about 30 minutes outside of downtown Atlanta. You will definitely need a car to get around. The hotel itself is modern and updated. It looks like the rooms have been recently renovated. The reason I gave the hotel only 3 stars is because there were a few hiccups during my stay. I don't want to get into specifics and make this whole review, a complaint. I would recommend the hotel if staying in the area for business. Other then that, I would look into downtown Atlanta.I am very sorry to hear you had a few hicups while in my hotel. I would like to hear more about them if you have the time to call me.

            " On check in we were greeted by a very helpful receptionist called Alex, unfortunately the rooms did not match up to the service ( the rooms were very old and decor was very dated, wallpaper from the late 80s. Room had a very strange smell and curtains did not reach the bottom of the ledge so the light from the car park flood lights were beaming straight through the window!!! The pillows were dreadful and the bed was so uncomfortable, we felt unsafe in this motel as well, walls paper thin and doors slammin constantly , very noisy outside too- i know this is not the hotels fault but just adds to the awful stay we had. we paid around 85 per night for this hotel which may seem reasonable for location, however we stayed at the coventry motor inn just up the road and it was by far do much better than the Francisco bay inn.Overall good location and staff but dirty, noisy, dated , smelly motel rooms!!!!

            " Although the lobby of the hotel is nice, beyond that is a dated, tired hotel. We arrived earlier than check-in so went up to the pool deck. Lounge chair covers were stained in the private seating areas. Main deck chairs were old and dingy. Cigarette butts from the night before were still on the pool deck. Check in finally came at 3:30. There were over 55 people in line waiting and two people behind the desk checking us in. When we finally got our room in the Annex, we quickly turned around and went back down to the lobby to change it. First off, the elevator to the Annex is behind the desk of the diner and it looks like it was once the service elevator. We heard the Annex had been an old Holiday Inn. The hallway lights were partially burned out, the carpet was frayed and dated and the room smelled like disinfectant and the carpet was damp (don't know with what). The wall had a hole in it the dresser drawer was cracked and falling apart and the bathroom tiles were broken in spots. Our next room had a nice balcony with a view of the spa pool in the same worn out Annex. The spa pool was dirty and were were told that someone had thrown a glass bottle into it a couple of days back and they were waiting for a diver to come and take out the pieces of glass so they could clean it. The room didn't smell but the sliding door to the balcony was off the track so it wouldn't open and the wall had a missing large picture (someone had painted around it at one point and you could see the outline of the picture) and there was a large hole in the wall that had been covered up with electrical tape. The only bright spot was Bob, the maintenance person, who brought us a painting to cover the wall and fixed our door. Obviously the hardest working man at the Chelsea! All in all, the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in and will never return to the Chelsea. I live outside of Philadelphia and travel to Atlantic City a lot. This was my worst trip to date.\n",

They did a nice remodel and the staff are friendly, HOWEVER this time, we booked a room for THREE and received an upgrade to a larger room but with only ONE bed and a pullout couch. The couch was not comfortable for our 12 year old. The corner room smelled very musty, there was not enough towels for three either. Frustrating when you are a marriott member, they have your profile, you book a room for three and they can't even have enough towels and only one housecoat.

I was treated like I was staying a high end hotel The location is perfect if you are using the MARTA. If shopping is your thing the hotel is attached to a high end mall. They also provide shuttle service within 2 miles of the hotel. We used to to go to dinner. If was efficient and very handy. The room was just ok. I felt it should have had higher end luxuries for example: large, fluffy towels. The room was set for 2 but only had 1 bathrobe. We ate breakfast at the buffet set in the lobby. The service was marginal at best. I asked for a coffee warmup twice and had to get out of my seat to find the waiter and remind him. Certainly unacceptable service for a JW.\n",

Overall, I am highly satisfied with my stay, would recommend it and will certainly come back again. The hotel is very well positioned in the city, close to the large shopping center and quick access to major city landmarks. The rooms are decent size particularly when you consider you are in the downtown core of San Francisco. I had a king size suite, very comfortable, clean, and a well appointed interior. The suite was located internally, away from the busy street which made it very quiet. The hotel staff was very professional, attentive to my requests, and I would like to to thank Christian, Nabih, front desk personnel and everyone else for making my stay at Hotel Abri very enjoyable experience.\n",

The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such.

            " Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us.

After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly.

I had problems printing my boarding ticket prior to leaving the hotel and the front desk allowed me to e-mail my ticket to them and they printed it for me.

            " This hotel has many good points, most notably its location. Unfortunately, it also has some aspects that didn't live-up to expectation. The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place.

            " This place was somewhat too expensive for me, but I chose it because close distance to the Convention Center was critical for me, and closer hotels were even more expensive. The place is just 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. The road from the enter to the hotel is uphill. My room was clean and spacious, with a closet. The windows faced downhill with a broad view. The only problem was a fan below the windows. I heard its noise when I opened the window. Nevertheless, my overall rating is very good.Dear mikhail534, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Hotel Sorrento.I am so pleased to know that you enjoyed the hotel's location and the guestroom appointments, I am, however, disappointed to learn of fan noise, when you opened the window. Please know that I very much appreciate your feedback, as it is only in this way that we can improve upon our shortcomings. We hope you will return again so we can ensure your stay is flawless from beginning to end. Best regards, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director\n",

Not much of a view and close to the lifts but very spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was very good - cava included - but we got a better price at the desk. We used the outside pool area which was lovely and also enjoyed drinks on the terrace bar. Pricey but worth it for the view.

I'm glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised with how fast and easy it was to get to the park using the shuttle. It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front. I'm not sure how I would feel about the breakfast if I had been with a larger family with kids, but I did notice you can get pancakes for 2 so maybe it wouldn't be so bad.\n",

            " This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower it was fun to open it a crack watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location. I booked this stay through booking.com and was pleased to find that this did not affect how we were treated at all.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us. As you mentioned, we are located two blocks from the hospital, but by city ordinance, the ambulances are supposed to turn off their sirens when they are four blocks away. Please know that I will be following up with our local ambulance services about their compliance with this ordinance. Otherwise, I was pleased to see that you enjoyed your experience. We look forward to seeing you again soon! My best, Sam Johnson\n",

If you're looking for any sort of view at the end of the day - take a 3 block walk to the waterfront and enjoy - because there's not a view to be had from your room.(we had 6 people there in all different rooms) It is a great location - close to most of the best spots in Seattle. The rooms are comfortable, but not worth the non-corporate rates. I would have been embarrassed to charge breakfast on my corporate card because it was so overpriced. So avail yourself to one of the many coffee shops.Hello Michael C, thank you so much for your feedback.

Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us.

            " Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor.

The price is too good to pass up for a place with very good reviews when compared to the other options in the vicinity of downtown. Each night the bar/restaurant on the ground floor draws an eclectic mix. The food and drinks are outstanding and the movies shown in the courtyard each Wednesday night make for a fun atmosphere.The rooms are very simple, but nice. The main issue I had was with the noise level in the room. Even with a room at the back of the building, the early morning traffic noise from the busy street on which the Pearl is located easily was enough to wake a person and keep them up. Facility parking is not free, but there is ample street parking a block away.Don't check out before trying the Brussels sprouts at the restaurant.Appreciate you taking time to leave us a review. truly appreciate your support and comments.

We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over.

The room had been renovated recently (new carpet, paint, trim, counter, furniture, TV service appliances, bath updated) Very comfortable. As I went outside, I noticed more about the grounds. New paint on the buildings, landscaping was very tidy. Everything was orderly and clean without being overdone (ala Disneyland).This property gives the impression of an ownership that takes pride in their establishment both in the physical presentation and in the service of the staff. They have worked hard to make thoughtful choices and quality improvements. Great value for the price.\n",

            " I really liked this place but my wife was a bit tepid on it. In our opinion, there were lots of upside. First of all, affordable. We stayed in room no. 9 which was a junior suite. Great, vintage couch. Goldfish named Bruce Lee on the wall. Patio. Air conditioning. The location is away from downtown in an area called Point Loma that has good restaurants (walking)and the Cabrillo National Monument Area nearby (driving). There are even some bayside beaches. I swam at one and it seemed pretty clean. And the pool at the Pearl is small but great. Drinks and music poolside! We pretty much had it to ourselves twice. It also has its own restaurant but we didn't eat there. Near the airport, too, but we drove in.Downside: my wife disliked the hard bed intensely. The traffic noise from the street is loud. Parking is limited and ten bucks extra. No guarantee you'll get a spot. Far from downtown and no trolley nearby. Pillows were absurdly uncomfortable! Go figure. That sounds like an oxymoron: uncomfortable pillows. My wife complained that there was no full-length mirror. Oh, well. More upside than downside in my book. I thought it was so different from the average hotel and I really enjoyed that. Cool place.Appreciate your review and comments. Hope you will come stay with us again in the future. Tell a friend.\n",

The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit.

            " We were upgraded and the roomWas nice. It was on the highway but the noise was minimal. Breakfast was very good! They provide a paying shuttle (21 a day PP) to Mallory Square. It stops at three other hotels first. One time it was already full when it arrived so we had to wait for a second shuttle. Coming back the shuttle was packed. Even though there are signs that clearly state no standing, they packed us in like sardines. The driver Tommy D even allowed passengers to sit on the steps! This was too dangerous and should not be permitted! I would NOT recommend the shuttle, the Old Time Trolley has a pickup two blocks away, I would use this as it is cheaper and they charge 10 PP for the second day. Cheaper!!! Only problem is the last stop is at 5 PM. I am told Taxi's are fairly cheap! They need to get Uber on the island!I would return!Thank you for sharing your experience.

I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko, Kimpton, etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.\n",

It was a short walk from the Sante Fe station, a short walk to the Westfield Mall and the Gaslight Quarter, a very short walk to Little Italy and a 20 minute walk from Petco Park. We took a bus to the San Diego Zoo from the Sante Fe station. San Diego is a lovely city for sightseeing and getting around easily.The hotel was lovely, we had a room overlooking the harbour. The bed was large and very comfortable. The pillows were also good. It was always clean.Breakfast is served in the next door restaurant and we found this to be good. Always got a table. The buffet items were plentiful and we have no complaints. It saved us trying to buy breakfast at extortionate rates elsewhere. The staff were all happy and helpful.

Jamie, our key west concierge was excellent. she helped us navigate our way through key west. she also helped us book our watersport tours with Fury Water Adventures which was a great experience.Dear pchyluv2,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are happy that you loved your stay with us. It is also Great to see our Concierge Name mentioned and that she was so helpful. We are glad you had a Great 1st time experience to Key West and we hope to see you back again soon for another.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager\n",

            " Great location, clean and large sized room. We forgot a ten year old bottle of wine in a drawer along with a blood pressure monitor upon checking out. When we remembered the next day that we had forgotten the items, we returned in hopes of recovering our items. Unfortunately the unit was re-rented and the guests were not in their room. So we figured we were out both our wine as well as our blood pressure unit.To our surprise some days later the front desk girl (a very kind young lady named Darby) contacted us and said she had both our forgotten pieces. She had searched her computer until she finally found our name and contacted us. Coming from Hawaii we were happy to feel the aloha spirit in California.....very refreshing. Thanks again for a great stay!Dear penn3222, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at Chablis Inn. We are so happy to hear you had a great room experience, and were satisfied with our location. We're also happy that our staff was able to assist in returning your forgotten items, and we have shared your feedback with them. We know you have many choices when you visit Wine Country and we are honored that you chose Chablis Inn. We hope to see you next time you are in town! Dawn P.\n",

            " Stayed here for 3 nights, arrived at 8.30pm, and was given the key by a male person who answered the door bell (he didn't say who he was). Found our room on the 3rd floor, but there were no lights on on in the room, and it took me ages in the dark to find the lamps!! Not the warmest welcome!!The room was huge and beautifully decorated, and the bed was comfy. The room looked onto Commonwealth Ave. which was nice, but there was lots of noise, especially in the mornings. The bathroom was a little dated, and needed a bit of sprucing up. Very clean otherwise. The breakfast is continental, and there were homemade cookies available from about 4pm, and unlimited tea and coffee. There is no TV in the bedroom, but we didn't mind.Fantastic location, easy walk to Bostom Common and local restaurants. We parked at Boston Common garage, lots of parking, and cost around 25 per day.\n",

The best part is that one of our family members left his laptop behind in the room, and only realized it two days later. One might think that was the end of it. But V.J. went above and beyond to work with UPS for multiple requested pick ups, and returned the laptop in perfect condition!! Great job and you can't ask for better, more honest and hard working staff in any hotel - anywhere.Dear Valued Guest,At the outset,many thanks for choosing the Quality Inn Suites Atlanta.Glad to note that you found the hotel and the staff very nice and helpful.The morale of our hotel staff shall boost after your comment on VJ.We have conveyed your wishes to VJ and congratulated him for his honesty and trustworthy hospitality.We look forward to see you again soon.Sincerely,Hotel Manager.\n",

            " I love everything about The Pearl Hotel and Restaurant! I booked the Essentials package, that came with free parking for your stay, two complimentary cocktails, and one appetizer. I stayed in Room 3 and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and I had a wonderful nights sleep. The room comes with a small patio area, which in my opinion is just ok. I think it could be a little bigger and more private, but if your not going to use it then it shouldn't be a big deal to you. At the Restaurant, the bartender was awesome! He knows what he's doing and is willing to help you out. A+ for the serivce he gave. I think his name might of been John Don't quote me on that though! lol The ONLY things that I think could be improved would be the bathroom, carpeting, and mosquito problem. The carpeting in the room was almost rope like in feeling so I wore sandals when I walked around. The bathroom was not disgusting but it did look run down. There was also this strange occurance of several small mosquitos I caught flying in the room. I think they might be coming from the plants. Those problems are small and the rest of the experience was so great , I was able to overlook the little things. Don't get me wrong, I am super picky when it comes to hotels! I highly reccommend staying here. For people who are constant complainers (you know who you are) don't stay here if you want a nice quiet getaway, there is a Hilton down the way for you.thanks for the GREAT REVIEW!!!!! Super cool. Appreciate it. John is awesome. will let him know.

Our junior suite was comfortable, good size, quiet and immaculate. Slept great on the comfortable bed. Front desk staff was very friendly and willing to help with purchasing tickets to the Atlanta Aquarium and Atlanta History Center and even offered discount tickets. Lobby was modern and inviting. We used one of their meeting rooms for 3 days and was very impressed with the view from the 12th floor room. Pitchers of ice water and glasses were delivered every morning with a smile. Will definitely return in the near future!Thank you very much for recently choosing our Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Midtown.

She had requested dbl beds but be cause her room on her profile was king size, we ended up with a chair and a king size bed for 4 ppl. The next day we waited for someone to contact us and know on did.. We had to go to the desk and ask. They gave us a room w king bed and a pull out which would have been alright but we would have gotten exactly what was needed from another hotel in the area and cheaper if someone would have told us earlier in the day.After that they gave us one thin blanket for the pull out. Requested another and they were out. Finally got one . when the maid came to clean she took one of the blankets. We had to call down to correct that.. All in all it was a good trip but bad service... They need to communicate more with each other and there guess that are having problems to make there stay enjoyable and uncomplicated.Thank you for visiting the JW Marriott Atlanta for your special occasion. I am sorry we did not have the requested accommodations. I am also sorry that your blanket was slow to arrive and then once received, was removed by our housekeeping team. You can be certain I will personally speak with our housekeeping team to share your experience and to also ensure we are communicating with one another to ensure our guests are happy and comfortable.

But , considering the location to the airport, Amtrak Location, and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants,bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And, about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel, you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar,with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member, you can't get a better deal ,period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night, 50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty!

            " Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.\n",

            " Although the accommodations were nice, the service and amenities weren't up to the standard you'd expect at a JW Marriott. Specifically -- when we reserved our room we indicated 4 guests, but on arrival were assigned a room with 1 king bed. The first staffer we spoke with was very unaccommodating. After speaking with a different staffer, we were able to change to a room with a king bed + sofa pull out. Unfortunately we found that room had no linens and it took 3 calls to the front desk to have them delivered. Lastly, the air in our room didn't work well and it stayed warm throughout our visit. I did, however, find the valet staff and the Nox grille staff to be very attentive. The breakfast buffet at Nox was delicious. This hotel has the makings of a wonderful luxury hotel, but needs a bit more attention to some of these finer details. Thank you for your visit and review. I am disappointed to learn about your service failures as we pride ourselves in providing outstanding services and exceeding our guests expectations. The service you received is not typical for the JW Marriott Atlanta. I do hope that you will feel free to contact me directly so that I can personally discuss your visit in more detail.

            " Arrived after a long trip. Got to the hotel after 11pm and discovered that even though I had a guaranteed reservation, there was no room waiting for me because they had overbooked the hotel. They walked me to a Fairfield hotel about 8 miles away (great staff but a tad nasty and very worn hotel). I wasn't the only one walked. At least four or five other people had the same experience I did at the same time (and according to the Fairfield clerk--a lot of people have this happen). Maybe this was a lucky break. When I took the Fairfield van back to the Marriott in the early morning for a meeting I had there I discovered, according to one guest, that he had experiencced strange bugs (bedbugs) in his room that night.....so perhaps a golden lining.\n",

            " After spending a previous spring break at the Hilton Resort on Mission Bay, we decided to find a place on the ocean. The Ocean Park Inn was the perfect place for our family to stay. Based on reading other's reviews, we requested an upper floor ocean front room. The view from our room was fantastic and we even found enough space on the small balcony to enjoy a cold drink and watch the sunset. The best part is the location. Being right on the boardwalk meant we barely used our rental car the entire trip. We walked north on the beach and explored the tide pools, we walked to lunch, we walked to dinner and were never bored walking south from the hotel.If we are ever in San Diego again, Pacific Beach and the OPI is where we will stay.We're happy to hear you and the family enjoyed spring break with us! You're absolutely right about our location - there is so much to do within walking distance, but at the end of the day it's also nice just to enjoy the breeze and sunset from your balcony! Thanks for uploading some great pics as well - we'll see you next time.\n",

            " Last trip I refrained from reviewing after a rather bad experience. I believed it was a one shot occurrence. Last trip, I was given room keys that didn't work for the parking. Returned to the desk and received a lukewarm sorry. I stayed for 4 nights. My room was left completely un-cleaned one day and not well cleaned the other. When I informed the front desk, another lukewarm sorry. After I asked to see the manager, the desk person offered reward points instead because the manager was not available. Arrived today, front parking attendant asked for my car key while I checked into the hotel. Mind you, the front desk is in view from the entry way. I haven't been asked that in the last 2 visits. I asked him why and he said that people parked there and left their cars. He needed my key in case I did that. He reluctantly gave me a ticket after I asked - his reasoning was I can see you from here at the desk. Huh Wasn't that my reasoning as well except as the customer A rewards member, I was asked for my information though the person making the reservation a month ago took all my information. Got my keys - one opens the parking deck and one opens the room door, but neither does both. Can't wait to see what else I encounter while here.\n",

            " Walked into the room and it was small and sparsely furnished but, I guess there really was no room for a table. The A/C-Heat was the typical in that it had 2 temperatures (arctic and sauna) and nothing in between. The TV was difficult to turn off and on. There was only 1 glass in the entire room. The toilet had to be jiggled to stop running. This room was across the hall from a storage room and there seemed to be constant noise all the time. It seemed to be a novel way to turn a run down motel into a boutique hotel with a few contemporary furnishings that could not disguise the fact that it was an old motel. The tub had numerous gouges in it and you could see daylight threw the door (great insulation). We were charged an extra 10 to park and after returning from going out to dinner all the hotels spots were taken and we had to park 3 blocks away. We checked out and were never asked how our stay was or even thank you for staying with us. Will not be returning or recommending this hotel to friends or family.Good day and Happy Holidays. In receipt of your review. Very sorry you were disappointed with your experience. all of your comments are noted and will be discussed with management.

            " Everything was good until we received our bill. We confirmed our reservation on the phone before arrival at 107 a night. At check in, we were told to initial next to our room rate of 107 a night. On departure date we discover there is a charge of 125 for the second night. We asked to see the card we signed when we arrived and it certainly did have 107 next to our initials in the top right hand corner, but over to the left in small print it said 125 for second night. So, here is another scam we must all be aware of, and worse, the person at the desk just turned his head away and said sorry about that. Actually, sorry about that right back to you, because we will never stay at a Homewood Suites again with such deceptive trickery.

            " My family and I visit La Jolla every year for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. We try different hotels every year. This year we stayed at the beautifully appointed Pantai Inn. Our room was very well renovated with a full kitchen and awesome bathroom. Spacious and clean, but the master bed was a double and too small for comfort. My daughter slept on the Murphy Bed. Unfortunately, we heard every noise from the upstairs unit. The jumping, walking and screaming was very unsettling and kept us from relaxing. There was a beeping noise outside our bedroom the entire which kept us from sleeping. To say the least the location is great and property really nice, but we wouldn't suggest staying there for a romantic, relaxing or quiet weekend. Dear Friend,Thank you so much for your comments, we appreciating hearing from our guests.I am truly sorry to hear your stay at Pantai Inn was disrupted by the guests in the room above you. The Inn was sold out that weekend for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. If we would have had another room we would have gladly upgraded you to something that was not below other guests. I hope you understand this is not a normal occurrence at the Inn. Most of our guests come here for a quiet romantic getaway and hopefully you will give us another opportunity to serve you again. If you would, please contact me by email at danpantai.com, or telephone directly (858)224-7620 to discuss this further.

Our room was huge, bathroom a great size and a cute little balcony where we sat out and watched the sun set over the ocean. We were not over looking the pool which I was grateful as in the afternoon it was very busy.The hotel is located right on the boardwalk, and a few minute walk to the pier. It is surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants and only a short drive to Sea World ( 8 mins).Breakfast was included in the price too which included waffle maker, toaster, cereals, muffins, fresh fruit, juices and a coffee machine. There is a tv in the breakfast room which was nice to be to catch up on some news. After breakfast we had a short play at the beach before returning to the heated pool. At this hour ( 9.30 ) we were the only ones there. We met a very helpful young man who was placing the towels on the pool lounges. He was full of information about the local area.We really wish we could have stayed a few more days, we felt relaxed and at home at Ocean Park Inn , we will be back for sureIt sounds like you had a wonderful vacation!

The place has a musty smell and everything is extremely run down - but okay, fine, its one night. Go to an elevator behind the diner. The elevator is barely in service. There is a blinking neon sign that reminds you that this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The walls and carpets are drab/dark and the lighting is dim.First room we go in, okay seems fine, upon further inspection a GIGANTIC hole in the wall. Called the front desk and they could not have seemed more apathetic. No, OMG we are so sorry! Instead there was okay we will change it... fine....Second room, smells like ciggarettes but okay. Another smaller hole in the wall, but everything else seems okay. We go out, come back around 1 get ready for bed and lie down. Fiance and I cannot sleep with out noise so we turned on the AC - only heat came out, so we tried to sleep without it. Think again! This is where our nightmare began - you will hear every noise in atlantic city. From a bum sneezing, to some frat kids screaming, to some bachelorettes flirting with the frat guys I think I heard it all. I ended up going in the hall way and screaming some profane things at them.Cut to 5 am..this is still occuring. In fact, one of the frat guys smashed into our door with his entire body and screamed oh S*it I finally gave in and went to the front desk and asked them if they could do something - they sent two security guards (who to their credit were very nice) but could not do much to help. NEedless to say, we checked out immediately. The manager could not do much but gave us a credit. I Will be disputing the charge on my credit card. My favorite part - as we were walking out, blood was smeared all over the wall! Guessing it was one of the idiots that decided 5 am was a good time for a hallway wrestling match.IF you are thinking about staying here - think again! It is dirty, disgusting, run down and nothing like the pictures on the website. I actually think the fact that they even have those pictures on the website has to be illegal/unethical.\n",

            " The staff here are great, very friendly, front desk is efficient, valet parking is well organized. But, it's a resort with lots of young families, so if you're looking for a quiet time by the pool, not gonna happen, although the plunge pool area is noticeably quieter. I don't get why you need a card for towels and you have to sign for reclining chairs at the beach where you have to place a tag. The Westin next door has a bar and casual dining that is closer to the ocean, which we preferred. You can use your room card to charge at any of the adjacent Westin properties which was good.The rooms, which are called villas for whatever reason are very nice, great bathrooms, very comfy beds, kitchens are very functional. The doors to the rooms all slam shut, which was bothersome.You will get asked nice and politely, several times to take a timeshare tour, you can't miss the tours , they are going on al day in a certain pattern like the jungle cruise at Disneyland. Timeshare isn't for me, it's akin to owning a boat, a deep money pit.There is a scent floating around in the lobby, but overall, the people are wonderful and we enjoyed our stay.Aloha sas2kauai,Mahalo for your in depth review. While it seems that we fell short on some of your expectations, we appreciate the compliments regarding our front desk and valet teams.

            " I stayed in this hotel for work the week of December 17th. The location is attached to Lennox Square mall so it was very convenient to get some last minute Christmas shopping in without having the hassle of driving to/from malls. The hotel is located across the street from Lennox MARTA station and couldn't be easier to get to from the Airport, however it's pretty much a car-kinda-town so unless you plan to be in one location . .I'd drive. The hotel itself was nice with good public rooms and the rooms themself were standard Marriott / Renaissance style. The bedding and bathrooms were good also -- always nice to have a freestanding shower in the bathroom. The only peeve I have really is to be charged for internet connection. In this day -- especially with lower category Marriott brands like Courtyard / Fairfield Inn / Residence Inn not only charging lower but offering free internet -- it's bothersome. Nearby and walkable are plenty of restaurants both inside the mall and along the perimeter so there's no want for eating. I didn't try the hotel restaurants as I'm Platinum and usually have breakfast in the lounge. The lounge itself was fine and served a variety of breakfast foods. The nighttime snacks were a bit scant -- but hey, it's free so can't complain on that!Lastly -- there is a Westin directly across the wide parking lot so if you need to stay in Buckhead and want to be walkable to the mall both will do just fine. JW Marriott though is the only of the two actually connected to the mall whereas the Westin is in the outside of the parking lot.\n",

The hotel is extremely convenient to local businesses plus a host of other major attractions in this part of Atlanta. Most notable will be the new Atlanta Braves stadium right across the highway from this property. Very comfortable rooms and friendly staff, plus great concierge lounge.

            " I stayed here on a recent work trip. I didn't like the valet-only parking option. It took a long time in the morning to get the car, since there were a lot of people coming at the same time, and nobody was in a rush. C'mon folks, it's time for us to get to work, can't you do more than walk slowly to retrieve our cars for which we're paying 20/day for you to park in the big empty garage upstairs Anyhow, the lobby is beautiful at the hotel. My only gripe is that the restaurant has very few good tables because of the awkward design of the restaurant in the lobby. The bar is very pleasant and quite cool for a Hilton Garden Inn, and the bartender was very friendly. Front desk staff at the hotel were very friendly too. Room was modern, big, and clean. The gym was pretty good, though the TVs on the treadmills didn't get many good channels. Hopefully next time I'll stay here but just ride MARTA instead of suffering the cost of the parking. Overall, though, very sharp design, clean spaces, and friendly staff.\n",

            " On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager\n",

            " The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.\n",

I am genuinely sorry to read about your disappointment with our guests rooms, specifically regarding the size, smell, and the welcome amenities provided as it seemed that our accommodations were not comfortable for your needs and no value added was provided to you during your stay also I am truly sadden to hear that our gift bag and selections were not well received, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 60 gift bags per day and we update our amenities every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of your disappointment with the choice of sangria, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience.We are a currently following up with our housekeeping department on the strange smell, so we can ensure this situation will not surface in the near future. While the building structure is a historical building from 1907, and still maintains many of the architecturally historic qualities from the early 20th century including the interior corridors and original room layout, we are very proud of the overall quality, furniture and modern condition of our property. However this is not an excuse to justify your experience during your stay, we tried to provide you with all the amenities our property has to offer, but as we can see we fail on the delivery. I would like the opportunity to further discuss the details and concerns. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800.

            " My husband, 18 year old son and I made our first visit to Chicago and stayed here on the 19th floor of the Comfort Suites on Michigan Avenue. It was a great choice! The elevators were fast (good for a claustraphobic like me!), our suite was roomy and had all the conveniences we needed, and the view of the river, the street below and the amazing architecture around us was outstanding! Other than taking the Metra one day to the Museum of Science and Industry, we walked everywhere. There were more restaurants, shopping and theatres close by than we could ever visit in one trip. I felt totally safe at all times, and having a 7 Eleven just a few doors down was so convenient. I definitely recommend this hotel for families because of the washer and dryer, full kitchen and space. We had a large walk-in closet along with two smaller closets, and the living space was very spacious, even with two beds. Being in the middle of the shopping district and the park was great! All of the staff that we encountered were courteous, friendly and helpful. The parking was not a big deal (that actually was my biggest worry). We simply turned the car over to the attendant at the Hard Rock Hotel. We carried our bags ourselves to and from the hotel (a half block walk). The cost of parking is high, but it is everywhere in downtown. It did look like the self-parking lot was only a block further from the hotel, and we probably would use that next time, since we carried our own luggage anyway. (It's a lot cheaper) We did not move our car the whole time we were there, since everything was either within walking distance or the train.Dear smokemom,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review.

Even numbered rooms for great view.The goal was to have a fancy room, be treated as if we were special along with hours of shopping. I called in advance and talked with Yolanda a very pleasant receptionist who transferred me to Rory the concierge about ideasWell this hotel went above and beyond. Upon our arrival, Tania at the front desk placed us in rooms 1821 (corner room) and 1806 (standard). Rory had chocolate covered strawberries, chilled sparking water, a balloon tied to candy, and a personal birthday card addressed to my daughter which many of the staff had signed already waiting her arrival. Our rooms were clean, spacious, didnt have lingering smells hotel rooms often do so obviously the housekeeping staff is on the ball. The corner room was spacious and beautiful, but the view wasnt as impressive and outstanding as our 1806 room which looked directly at downtown Atlanta. I suggest to anyone to get standard rooms on the even numbered side of the hotel. We shopped all day and then to dinner (Atlanta Fish Market), spent a few hours at the spacious Roman like pool, and slept in extremely comfortable beds. I want to add even the complementary shampoo actually had lather to it. Room service for breakfast provided a fabulous meal and even the coffee in the in room 4 cup pot wasnt too bad. My only adverse comment about my stay and this is being picky because the hotel had an event going on was I called ahead from my room for our car, about 10 minutes, and when we got downstairs they still had not brought the car up and we barely made our dinner reservation. I also was not too thrilled with the 30 dollar overnight parking fee.

            " For the second time in three months I booked a Marriott despite unfavorable Tripadvisor reviews and found the reviews to be wrong. This hotel had fantastic staff, a very good restaurant and room service, and the perfect location. Nice size rooms and bathroom. Good fitness area and a safe walking area. I walked all over the area day and night and felt safe. Taylor Street has great restaurants, it is Little Italy. I never had to use a cab as I walked to UIC and dinner. So, I saved a lot on cab fares and maybe that helped offset the expense. The room rates are high, above 325 for two nights and 265 for two nights. Also, in contrast to other reviewers, Gold and higher get free internet, free breakfast. Shuttle is free for one mile. Internet is weak on end rooms. Again, expensive but sometimes rates are lower. If you need to be in this area and can afford it, stay here and you will not be disappointed. If the expense bothers you, find another place, cab everywhere you need to go and see how you feel.

            " We were supposed to stay here on September 30, 2012, but we had to change our plans. I canceled the reservation on August 20th and got a confirmation email about the confirmation. I was well within the 72 hour cancellation time period so that I would not be charged as a no show. I found out a couple of days ago that they charged my card anyway. I forwarded the confirmation email to them and asked them why they charged me, the general manager wrote back that he did the research, and because the reservation was never cancelled on their end, it wasn't considered cancelled, and I was being charged as a no show. He did, however offer me a credit towards a one night stay if I come to Napa in the next two years, which I won't. Needless to say, I'm disputing the charge with my bank.\n",

Had a light dinner in their lounge and was really impressed with the wine list by glass, salad, and their service (ask for the bread service with the honey and butter). The hotel is conveniently next to the Lennox Mall and MARTA. Would stay there again anytime. if they had free internet and their towels were better - it would be have been a 5.\n",

            " I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel. Im thrilled you were pleasantly surprised during your stay and truly appreciate your feedback. Although it seems you enjoyed a majority of your stay, I am sincerely sorry about the lingering smell of the perfume. All of us here at the Orchard Garden Hotel would love if you decided to stay with us again. Thanks again Quinn McEntee Front Office Manager\n",

When we arrived our booking (made in April via Orbitz) was not on the system, however, this did not impact our checkin and once I produced the booking confirmation from Orbitz we were checked in within minutes. We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient.The rooms are very comfortable and we thought them to be a good size. As mentioned previously the beds are very comfortable and the room is kept spotlessly clean.Breakfast is included and the homemade scones are not to be missed. Free internet access is also available which is another bonus.The hotel is in an excellent location and I would definitely stay there again.\n",

The bad: while the room itself is updated the bathroom still needs a lot of work. I stepped on a nail coming out of the carpet when walking into the bathroom. The front desk staff was just okay, 2.5 star quality. The A/C was loud and didn't work that well. The Ugly: there were no parking spots at the hotel. We drove around for 20 minutes looking for a spot. We finally gave up and where told That we could park in the neighboring garage. I feel they should let you know that in an email before you arrive. Thank you very much for the feedback. I am sorry that your experience was not better, but I assure you it is not typical. Our parking lot normally has plenty of parking spaces, I am sorry this was not the case when you were here.

            " The Chablis Inn is a decent little place. Any hotel review in Napa requires you keep your perspective. Napa is one of those places where 300+ a night rooms are common. My room was about 100 (Motel 6, next door, was about 20 less). The room was small, clean, with a mini fridge and microwave. Everything worked. Beds average for comfort. Dog friendly at 25 per dog per night empty lot on side of hotel to walk them. One of the best dog parks in California, Alston Park, is a 5 minute car ride away. Starbucks just across the street. Hot tub not used but looked very clean. On the downside, you could hear creaking with every step of the person in the room above. Old non-flat panel tv with limited channels. Room heater a bit noisy. Convenient but busy location. Would stay here again.Booking note: While waiting to check in I overheard part of a conversation regarding some kind of problem with the room/reservation with another guest. The management was responding by telling the guest they couldn't do anything about the issue since they had booked thru a third party. The you didn't pay us, you paid them line. I see this more and more these days with hotels, airlines, etc. It seems to be a technique to encourage people to book directly with the business. I am not saying the Chablis Inn is a bad guy here I don't know the specifcs. I am just pointing out the general issue of how one books travel and how it affects you if there is a problem.I appreciate all of the positive information that you shared. We continue to upgrade our property and addressing the T.V's and programming offered is currently being reviewed.The guest issue was unfortunate.

The Chelsea and it's owners (same as Congress Hall in Cape May) should be mortified having their name associated with this wing of the hotel. It felt like a low budget refugee motel. Upon entering our room we promptly called the front desk and had our room upgraded to the other side of The Chelsea and out of The Annex. The whole feel of the Annex was dirty, banged-up and worn out. The bathroom was something straight out of the 70's and not the boho-chic 70's. The furniture in the room was below standard and reminded me of poor garage sale finds. If The Annex underwent a huge refresher...you would have a gem on your hands.\n",

They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me.

We spent the last day of our trip traveling back to where we made the purchase, only to find that it was the hotel's dvd player. So we wasted the entire last day of our trip.

I knew we wouldn't be in the room much so we didn't care about having a nice pool, view, etc. we just needed a clean place to sleep and that's what we got. I was a bit concerned because the hotel was either full or close to it and was quite noisy. We were in the room next to the ice machine which was really loud. By the time we got back from our evening out, about 10pm, all was quiet and we got a good night sleep. The room was nothing special but clean and suited our needs. The tv remote only worked by pushing the numbers for the channels but we survived. Breakfast is included.Thank you for taking the time to write a review.I am very glad to see that you enjoyed your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay and were happy with the cleanliness of your room.

            " We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.\n",

The staff is the best, helpful, friendly, and outgoing. The room we had this time was the Penthouse with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I believe there are two penthouses but I don't know if they are both 2 bedrooms. We had a small balcony and a view of the park and Sears/Willis Tower. The room itself was in need of some cosmetic repair,peeling wall paper, paint scraped in spots, water damage marks. The place was functional for us and we did not complain, we were just happy to be back in Chicago. The room we had on our first visit was an executive suite facing the River and was in much better condition. This will continue to be my go to place in Chicago because of the staff and I know that not all rooms are in need of repair. I still believe this is one of the best hotels in Chicago.

Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed.

            " I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!\n",

            " I stayed two nights mid-week in March. I didn't pay extra for the bay view but got it because just as we got in there was a large group of German tourists who just came in, which probably booked other rooms.The two queen beds were comfortable. and the pillows were nice and fluffy. In fact we saw many being replaced the day we checked in. (They were taking out old mattresses and bringing in new ones.) The amenities are good. A TV with cable, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made the fact that there's no continental breakfast easy, since there's a rite-aid down the street we bought hot-pockets and ate those in the morning. The view of the bay is amazing although it's true there is a concstruction sight to the right it's not very noticeable when you have the sun setting and the Star of India right in front of you.The pool isn't special and the jets on the hottub didn't work very well but the hottub was hot so that was nice after hours of walking. There are towels in the pool area which I also thought was nice. The constuction was not as noisy as people have said, although to be honest my friends and I left our room about 10:30 everyday and returned in the evening 6pm- midnight. Noise is a problem though as there is a railroad crossing a few blocks away, which you can hear clearly even with the balcony window shut. At night, cruise ships dock at the harbor which is also a few blocks away but the boats horn woke me and my friends up. This happened both nights we stayed and the second night two cruise ships came in so we were awakened twice that night!!! I can't imagine any of the other hotels in the area being any better though. There are hotels right across the street from the harbor which I think have to hear the same noise. I believe it's just a consequence of staying in a city.The area of the hotel isn't particularly nice, but it isn't particulary ghetto either. If you walk up India Street like 2 blocks there are a lot of nice little shops and places to eat and drink. (It's Little Italy) You can pretty much walk everywhere you want to go or take a cab - Horton Plaza to the hotel was 4. The parking lot is strangely full. I assumed many construction workers park thier cars there because once they were gone the parking lot cleared up a bit. The lack of an elevator in the parking lot is annoying because the stairs look gross. My friend drove down to the lobby, we took out the luggage and then she drove back up to find parking somewhere. 7 a night for parking is not bad at all, I'm surprised this is even a complaint. We didn't even use the car while in San Diego. We walked to the Harbor and took the Old Town Trolley hop on hop off tour that takes you pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city as a tourist.\n",

            " My sister, niece and I stopped in for dinner during her 21st birthday trip. First, let me say the staff made our night! Our server Jesse had some great tips on visiting San Diego and was so friendly and efficient! The busser Carter was equally friendly and helpful he helped situate our chairs over by the fire for after dinner cocktails, also by the pool! Together they were about the best I've encountered. Our delicious dinners were served poolside while a James Bond movie played on the big screen and Bond music played in the background. We felt like we were in the sixties in a Bond movie in a good way! Everything was very chic and cool but also very inviting. It was also 1/2 price wine night so it was just a perfect evening. I would recommend a stop here to anyone looking for a unique dining experience. I hear the rooms are also nice but unfortunately we did not stay here.Thank you for taking the time to leave a positive review. We greatly appreciate your support!

            " My fianc and I decided to have a last minute moment of relaxation over the weekend (June 25,2016) before our upcoming July 9th wedding so we decided to hit the beach and stay for an evening. I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot, cigarette burns on the floor, dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded, which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible.

We have Executive club access so that always makes a stay very enjoyable and the staff in the lounge were particularly helpful. The hotel has recently been refurbished and while still very Marriott in style is has more personal touchs that I have seen in other properties. Big plus points are the location, loads of great restaurants in easy walking distance, wonderful friendly helpful staff at all levels and a new thing was the little market shop by reception which was fantastic, not only the sweets etc that you would expect but drawers of everything from new shirts and ties to aspirin etc plus although pricey not unreasonable - my 4 headache pills were 3 but a necessity at the time. The only reason I am not giving the hotel and excellent is the very long wait for room service on Sunday night, Our pizza took forever to arrive and we had 2 or 3 phone calls to see if it was there or not which didn't inspire confidence that it was ever coming!\n",

The front desk agent was cold and didn't even make eye contact or greet us. We checked into the Annex side of the building...OMG how disgusting the Annex is!!! Better off at Motel 6! The elevator is so old scary...looks like from a horror movie. The hallway leading to our room was dark and dingy with broken lights. We couldn't find our room 205 because there was missing door on our door...we just guessed which room it was and stuck our key in and it worked. The bathroom was a nasty pink color with musty mildew around the dirty gray tub. Bathroom tiles on the floor was old, scratched, stained chipped! I found tiny hairs around the base of the toilet and sink. The carpet wall in the room were full of stains as well. We wore shoes at all times trying to avoid stepping on the stains. We asked for a wakeup call at 9am but they nevered called to wake us up. We woke up late at 10:30am and missed breakfast. Called the front desk to complain about not recieving a wake up call got Garry over the phone he implied that maybe we overselpt the wakeup call...His implications were RUDE obnoxious! I asked him for a late checkout and he offered extra 30min...How cheap stingy is that! Most hotels in AC have a 12pm checkout time... this place offers 11am checkout with 30mins late checkout! CHEAP!

The food in both was better than average. On the negative side...it's just the price. If you don't book this property well in advance or have a great corporate rate, you're going to pay well to stay here. If you can get a room at a reasonable rate, I'd recommend it.

The property is on a hill overlooking the Main Street of old Town San Diego with more Mexican restaurants than you ever thought possible. Getting back to your room on the hill may be a workout since you are going uphill. Bed was very comfortable and firm as that is my personal preference. The property covers 5+ acres so navigating the several different buildings can be a little tricky although they provide a colorful property map. The property is definitely older but it is clean and I did feel safe there at night although it is not the best lit property at night. Rooms are a little dark, however, and my room did not have a balcony and am not sure any did. They have two parking garages but small. They do charge 14/night extra for self parking. Overall, a good stay if you are looking for a sale, clean comfortable place to use as a base to do the tourist thing.Thank you for making the Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town your base for San Diego adventures! We appreciate the thoughtfulness you put into your review. It will be helpful for guests planning travel. If you have a specific preference of room location, please dont hesitate to ask before your next stay.

            " This Marriott is right across the street from Rush Medical Center, which is where I had scheduled knee replacement surgery. Many out of towners like myself, who are having surgery stay here, including the rich and famous. I had expected convenience but there was so much more. First, the food is remarkably good and the service was good as well. But what sets this place apart is the staff they are incredibly helpful to and supportive of the patients are are there for anything you need. So if you are coming to Chicago for surgery or other medical care, stay here!Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and the food in our dining outlet. Our staff looks forward to accommodating you in the future.\n",

Our room included breakfast with great choices and excellent quality. It is at the gates of Chinatown and we walked to North Beach which is always fun and interesting. Across the street are wonderful restaurants.It's wonderful to read that you not only appreciated your stay but also our green initiatives. However, saving water doesn't mean having to skimp on a luxurious bathroom. I'm glad your accommodations and tasty breakfast left you refreshed for a day in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Safe travels home, and we look forward to having you back again soon!Warmly,Collins C., Front Office Manager\n",

Room was large and quite spacious with wrap around windows that offered a nice view from the 7th floor. King sized bed and desk and complimentary Internet. Clean and looked to be recently renovated. Good location near shopping and restaurants and about 30-40 minutes to the Airport.

Club food was also surprisingly good, fresh and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel has a large central atrium. It is connected via a pedestrian bridge over the busy road to a very nice mall ( and a nice but not very busy one on the walk ). Lots of parking. Just across the freeway from the new Braves stadium will make this a very desirable place although does not look like this is a very pedestrian friendly area in general and no apparent easy walking route to the stadium.I have great news, there is a pedestrian bridge being build outside my hotel to the Braves stadium. It is scheduled to be open for the first pitch next year making the area around the hotel even more exciting! Come back and see us soon!\n",

            " Me and 4 of my friends had the privileged of staying in a beautiful 3 bedroom suite. It had a full kitchen (microwave, stove,oven, dishwasher, island and even a walk in pantry!), washer/dryer and 2 large bathrooms. It was the most comfortable stay ever! It was like having a home right on the beach. The resort has a concierge desk, which was very honest in their suggestions of places/excursions for us to go on. They had so many excursions options! We will definitely need to go back again and go on some of the excursions we did not get to go on due to lack of time. We spent a lot of the time just relaxing in their various pools and jacuzzi's or on the beach which we could literally see from the pools. Overall, it was the most pleasant stay that I have ever had, the resort had all you needed for a comfortable stay and there was plenty to do but if you needed to there was also plenty to do in the neighboring city as well.Aloha yqbettyboop,Mahalo for your review! We are pleased that our phenomenal concierge team was able to provide the framework for an excellent vacation on Maui. There are truly so many things to do and see on this world class island. Our 3 Bedroom Ocean Front Villas make our property stand out from the rest, at over 1,600 square feet in size. We are delighted that you had such a pleasant stay with us and we hope that you will return again soon to create more memories at Nanea.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)\n",

            " OK. It is not Bali, but it comes close. Our room was ocean front, second floor with porch, but entry just up four stairs. Couches and easy chairs on an ample porch right on the ocean...this alone was body and soul cleansing. Inside, a nice living room, full working complete kitchen, dining table, an desperate bedroom with a comfy king bed and decent bathroom. But this does really not describe Pantai. Add in an Ari Ungung, which of course is a fire pit, huge, and the place for a bottle of wine at night. Or perhaps tables after dark with fire heaters Breakfast, well prepared, top quality, and varied every morning. But then there is the service. Everyone, I mean everyone was gracious, polite, sincere, wanting to please, friendly and accommodating. You are greeted by a wonderful, ok, very pretty, Russian woman from St. Petersburg, who just makes you feel like you have chosen the right place, down to the fellow who comes around 7 PM to turn down the bed and leave chocolates and a hand inscribed good night note. This is a most unusual place in that superb management shows through everywhere in the most gracious way. We will return!ZBGreetings zabriskibound,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. I really enjoyed reading your description of what a unique place our oceanfront Inn is. There are very few (if any) places like us. We are pleased to see that all the hard work and effort is being noticed by our guests. Thank you for outlining the various amenities that we offer to our guests. Our complimentary deluxe continental breakfast is a marvelous way to start the day and our fire pit is a wonderful escape at the end of the day. Also, thank you for mentioning our service. All of the staff do a tremendous job in ensuring that our guests are satisfied. We are extremely fortunate to have a such a wonderful team. Hope to see you again soon. Thank you! Mike\n",

The hotel is located next to the I-4 highway, we had a room looking at the highway and it was good, no noise, you can see the Orlando Premium Outlet and some horses in a vast green area. The staff at the front desk totally helpful and polite. We had one bedroom suite and it was really comfortable, very clean. The free wifi connection excellent. The only thing I didn't like and I got bored was the breakfast. Everyday the same buffet breakfast: sausage and scrambled eggs. I think they should vary it. The dinner was good and delicious. The staff at the breakfast and dinner area very nice and they did a good job. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.Hi there zlbenites!Thank you very much for your positive feedback.

            " The hotel is horrifically overpriced. They say pillow top mattresses in every room, but the beds are not comfortable. There is no hairdryer in the room - you have to ask for it - and no coffee maker. All housekeeping does to clean the room is make the bed. No fresh towels, no new shampoo/conditioner. People are in the courtyard talking loudly until all hours of the night, which makes the rooms very noisy, and the hotel has no policy against it. The air conditioning units are very loud, which does help drown out the sound. The hotel will charge an extra 30 per day for incidentals and not explain that policy at either check in or check out. Though they refund it, they need to explain that clearly.\n",

The well appointed bath - which looked to be very recently renovated - was beautiful. But the fan was tied into the one switch for the lights in the bathroom. The fan sounded like a jet taking off. There were no other options for using the lights in the bathroom. We went to a store and bought ourselves a couple of plug in lights to light the bathroom for us so we could use it without the deafening noise. Other than that - our stay was as expected.\n",

Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes.

The two queen bed room was clean and comfortable, we got a great nights sleep, everybody enjoyed breakfast and the wife and I enjoyed the hot tub while the kids swam in the pool. Maybe we were just lucky, but we had the entire swimming pool room to ourselves even though the hotel was sold out for some local attractions in mid-July. The hotel was also nice and quiet despite being booked full. ALL of the staff were all also very wonderful and nice. The lady running the breakfast was nice enough to get us a washcloth to wipe off our 2 year old's face after breakfast despite being busy running around restocking all the breakfast foods. We will definitely stay with the Country Inn again if we have the chance!\n",

            " No choice of other hotels in the area as it was a busy weekend for students visiting colleges. The other hotels in the area didn't appear much better from the outside. This was within our budget and close to the colleges. It was okay. Rooms were clean and staff was pleasant and helpful. The T.V. only had about four channels and the water in the shower was barely warm. The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals , one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me. Next time I go to Ithaca, I may have to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget. Do I think it was worth the money No! I think they have a lot of nerve charging those rates for that kind of hotel, but like all the other parents visiting colleges that particular weekend, we didn't have much choice.\n",

            " NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.\n",

He passed me a paper to fill out with my contact information so I could have a receipt. As he proceeded to check me in the price hotel.com promised was a dollar less than what he was charging me which means that hotel.com price was not a guarantee so I was charged more. Although I had my email showing the price, the man continued to argue with me about the additional dollar and would not budge. It took all of 15 minutes to check into the hotel and the room was seedy. Cigarette burn on the toilet... Outdated and pretty much with the price we paid.

I immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the check in, apparently the room wasn't suppose to be in use they moved me into another room. Everything looked fine UNTIL my 3 year old son was wearing black shorts and socks and had sat on the floor only to get up and have his whole bottom and socks covered in WHITE FUR. I turned on all the lights and DISCOVERED that the carpet was covered in what seemed to be dog or cat fur, my mother in law and I looked at each other and noticed our clothes were covered in it too as well as our luggage. Once again I went downstairs as we were leaving for dinner asking the front desk if there was anyway to send someone to at least vacuum the room or to get me the vacuum so I do it, she said house keeping was gone and they could possibly send me one when I came back. I didn't get the vacuum and the next morning my mother in law woke up with a SWOLLEN face and itchy throat (she is MILDLY ALLERGIC to animal fur but thats how much fur was in the room that it caused her to have a SEVERE allergic reaction).

This hotel did not have a TV guide in the room nor on the TV screen for guests to know what was playing in Florida. That was the biggest complaint. There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future. I am sure the Hilton's are first class not the ones they attached their names to.\n",

            " Nice, clean and comfortable rooms. The beds were comfortable, too, although more pillow options would have been even better. I like a softer pillow than what was offered, but that's my own preference. We also had some trouble with the room air conditioning system, mostly due to the remote used to operate it, which seemed simple enough and we had thought we had things running properly, until we were awakened in the night due to the room being way too stuffy. That's when we discovered the remote had a hidden flap with more buttons that we randomly pressed until the A/C fan turned on. Sometimes being high-tech can be a problem, especially without instructions. A little card in the room to explain things would have been very helpful. The hotel was nicely maintained and the lobby was warm and inviting, with friendly staff. The breakfast was yummy with a few hot options (sausage, eggs and waffles) as well as the usual breads, cereals and pastries. We would gladly stay here again.\n",

Desk clerk was more interested in chatting about mundane and non-check-in related things to someone who was just standing there (assume it's another off duty employee) than checking us in. Did not remember to program the key cards, so after going up, we had to come all the way back down to get the keys programmed as it would not open door. Room was extremely poorly cleaned - there was hair and bits of hair everywhere in the bathroom - on the vanity and in the tub/ on tub walls.

Which doesn't make much sense since they are both about the same distance from the hotel. The room had a fridge and a separate sitting area which was nice. The bed was standard which for us wasn't very comfortable. They offered a free breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles and for two days they had potatoes but didn't on the last day. They also had the standard cereal, yogurt, etc. The hotel is right next to a Jack in The Box and across the highway from and IHOP. Overall it was a nice standard hotel.\n",

I just wanted to rest, not have to call the overnight attendant and wait for service. When I went to check out, I waited close to 5 mins for the attendant to appear and was unable to find him or locate him by calling I ended up just leaving my key on the counter. I mentioned my concern to the morning attendant when she called to say she didnt receive my payment. The room was already paid for. When discussing my concern the young lady I spoke to seemed nonchalant about my distaste for service and when I mentioned having a credit applied for a future visit she seemed perplexed that I would make such a request. I was not satisfied because they small issues and lack of service were an inconvenience to my reason for coming to the hotel.\n",

            " Hotel was OK. I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.\n",

We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload.

On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that).

            " Came up midweek for a quick break and an Orioles game, so did not spend much time in the hotel. But we were pleased with everything. Prices seemed high all over the area, perhaps because of an event at the convention center, so this was more than expected. But for what we wanted to do -- the aquarium, the ball game, a water taxi ride -- this is a great place to stay.\n",

The suite I stayed in had all of the amenities that I would have needed (had I actually cooked there). Very nice staff. I forgot my toothpaste and within minutes housekeeping brought me a new tube. Other places I've had to go to the front desk, or they would take hours. The work out room was a little dated, but they did have a total body machine that was good to use.\n",

            " Not Great, I stayed specifically for business, internet was down-very problematic, then they tried to bill me to copy & fax ppwk I HAD to do for work yet they said they offered a business center. I got into town from out of state very late & exhausted. Front desk attendant was nice but wreaked of cigarette smoke-GROSS! I had to leave early b4 breakfast that morning then was comming back b4 checkout & I got no food saved & I was starving! No food was available the night b4 either. Someone had unplugged lights & moved heavy bed flush against wall so I could fix them myself either. I called front desk because I didn't have any lights by bed only across room & they said oh well I'll call maintenance tomorrrow. Great, for $130-hotel sucked! I easily could've paid $10 & stayed @ a 4-star hotel king suite w/ a whirlpool in my room yet I chose this hotel & for as much money as it was, it was so NOT worth it. This Holiday in should simply be cheaper being that after high initial cost they expect u to pay for breakfast too. I would never stay there againh.\n",

However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about.\n",

A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen\n",

            " I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.\n",

On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.\n",

It had been five years since we last booked a room there and we went with Holiday Inn again because they were priced slightly lower than the other hotels nearby and because we had always had a positive experience before. We were not disappointed this time either. The entire property had been redone and tastefully redecorated. Our room had also been redecorated including the bathroom which had granite countertops and new shower fixtures. We ate dinner in the restaurant which was very nicely decorated. The menu offered a nice variety and although the food was not outstanding, it was good enough. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow at check in and in the restaurant.

Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized.
